            " United States Court of Military Commission Review. *1218 For Appellant: Francis A. Gilligan (argued); Major Jeffrey D. Groharing, JA, U.S. Army (on brief); Captain Keith A. Petty, JA, U.S. Army (on brief); Lieutenant Clay G. Trivett, Jr., JAGC, U.S. Navy (on brief). For Appellee: Lieutenant Commander William C. Kuebler, JAGC, U.S. Navy (on brief; argued); Rebecca S. Snyder (on brief); Dennis Edney (on brief); Nathan Whitling (on brief; argued).[1] Amicus Curiae for Appellee: Frank W. Fountain (on brief); Madeline Morris (Professor of Law, Duke University)(on brief); Stephen Bornick (Special Editorial Associate for Professor Morris)(on brief); Landon Zimmer (Special Editorial Associate for Professor Morris)(on brief); Allison Hester-Hadded (law student, Duke University)(on brief). Before ROLPH, FRANCIS, HOLDEN, Appellate Military Judges. OPINION OF THE COURT AND ACTION ON APPEAL BY THE UNITED STATES FILED PURSUANT TO 10 U.S.C. § 950d ROLPH, Deputy Chief Judge. In this appeal by the Government (hereinafter Appellant) we are called upon to interpret for the first time the jurisdictional provisions contained in the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (hereinafter M.C.A.)[2] as they relate to the trial by military commission of a Canadian citizen, Omar Ahmed Khadr, Appellee (hereinafter Mr. Khadr). Mr. Khadr was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2002, is currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and was pending trial upon charges that were referred for trial before a military commission. This interlocutory appeal was taken after the military judge presiding over Mr. Khadr's trial dismissed *1219 all charges against him without prejudice on June 4, 2007. The military judge's ruling was based upon his sua sponte determination that the military commission lacked personal jurisdiction over Mr. Khadr. Where a court has no personal jurisdiction over an accused appearing before it, it is generally powerless to act. See, e.g., Ryder v. United States, 515 U.S. 177, 187, 115 S.Ct. 2031, 132 L.Ed.2d 136 (1995)(Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals could not decide appeals because not properly appointed); Solorio v. United States, 483 U.S. 435, 442-451, 107 S.Ct. 2924, 97 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987)(describing history of court-martial jurisdiction); Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 32-36, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957)(no court-martial jurisdiction over civilians accompanying the forces overseas); Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 22-23, 76 S.Ct. 1, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955)(no court-martial jurisdiction over soldier discharged from service). The basis for the military judge's ruling was Appellant's failure to properly determine Mr. Khadr's status as an \"alien unlawful enemy combatant\" before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal (C.S.R.T.), which the judge ruled was an indispensable prerequisite to the military commission's ability to exercise personal jurisdiction under the M.C.A. The military judge further ruled that \"the military commission is not the proper authority, under the provisions of the M.C.A., to determine that Mr. Khadr is an unlawful enemy combatant in order to establish initial jurisdiction for this commission to try Mr. Khadr.\" See Military Judge's Order on Jurisdiction of June 4, 2007 at 1-2; Record at 21.  Appellant charged Mr. Khadr with various offenses arising during the period from on or about June 2002 to on or about July 27, 2002. The allegations include murder of a U.S. Soldier in violation of the law of war; attempted murder of U.S. military or coalition forces by making and planting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in violation of the law of war; conspiracy with Osama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri and other members of al Qaeda, an international terrorist organization, to attack civilians, destroy property, and commit murderall in violation of the law of war; providing material or resources in support of al Qaeda and international terrorism; and spying, in violation of 10 U.S.C. §§ 950v(b)(15); 950t; 950v(b)(28); 950v(b)(25); and 950v(b)(27) respectively. Each charge and specification alleged against Mr. Khadr asserts the jurisdictional claim that he is \"a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant.\" See Charge Sheet, Charges I-V (Appellate Exhibit (AE) 1 at 4-7) (emphasis added). The record of trial, pleadings of the parties, and allied documents contain allegations that Mr. Khadr received one-on-one \"private al Qaeda basic training\" in Afghanistan during June 2002, consisting of instruction in the use of rocket propelled grenades, rifles, pistols, hand grenades, and various other explosives. See AE 1 at 6; AE 17. In July 2002, Mr. Khadr is also alleged to have participated in \"land mine training,\" which involved the conversion of landmines to IEDs and their strategic placement as weapons to be deployed against U.S. military and coalition forces. Id. On or about July 27, 2002, at a compound near Abu Ykhiel, Afghanistan, Mr. Khadr is alleged to have been a member of a group of al Qaeda members that engaged U.S. military and coalition forces with small arms fire, killing two Afghan Militia Force members, and throwing a hand grenade which killed Sergeant First Class Christopher Speer, U.S. Army. Id. Mr. Khadr, though badly wounded in the engagement, was immediately treated on scene by U.S. military medical personnel. He was thereafter taken into custody, and ultimately transported to the U.S. detention *1220 facility located at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, where he presently remains. On September 7, 2004, a three-member C.S.R.T. unanimously determined that Mr. Khadr was properly classified as an \"enemy combatant\" and an individual who was \"a member of, or affiliated with al Qaeda,\" as defined by a memorandum issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense on July 7, 2004. See Report of C.S.R.T. (AE 11 at 6).  The military judge's ruling in this case dismissing all charges without prejudice qualifies for appeal by Appellant under 10 U.S.C. § 950d(a)(1)(A) in that it \"terminates proceedings of the military commission with respect to a charge or specification.\" See Rule for Military Commission (R.M.C.) 908(a)(1), Manual for Military Commissions (M.M.C.)(2007). Appellant properly gave notice of appeal to the military judge on July 3, 2007,[3] and filed the appeal directly with this Court within the time limits established in our Rules of Practice. See Rule 22, Rules of Practice, Court of Military Commission Review (2007). In ruling upon this appeal, we may act only with respect to matters of law. 10 U.S.C. § 950d(c); R.M.C. 908(c)(2). We have reviewed the military judge's factual determinations applying a highly deferential standard of review mandating that findings of fact not be disturbed unless they are \"clearly erroneous.\" See Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U.S. 214, 223, 108 S.Ct. 1771, 100 L.Ed.2d 249 (1988); United States v. Cabrera-Frattini, 65 M.J. 241, 245 (C.A.A.F.2007). Regarding all matters of law, we review the military judge's findings and conclusions de novo. See Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 800 (9th Cir.2004); Pederson v. Louisiana State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 869 (5th Cir.2000); United States v. Rader, 65 M.J. 30, 32 (C.A.A.F.2007).  The determination of whether an individual captured on the battlefield is a \"lawful\" or \"unlawful\" enemy combatant carries with it significant legal consequences (both international and domestic) relating to the treatment owed that individual upon capture and ultimate criminal liability for participating in war-related activities associated with the armed conflict. The Third Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW III) signed in 1949 and entered into force in 1950 following battlefield atrocities occurring during World War IIsought to carefully define \"lawful combatant\" for all signatory nations. Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, T.I.A.S. No. 3364, 75 U.N.T.S. 135, Art. 4.[4]*1221 See also Hague Convention No. IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, October 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, T.S. No. 539 (Hague Regulations). Article 4, GPW III makes it clear that lawful combatants will generally only include the regular armed forces of a party to the conflict, including \"members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.\" Also included are members of other militia, volunteer corps, and organized resistance movements belonging to a State party to the conflict so long as they fulfill the following conditions: This critical determination of \"lawful\" or \"unlawful\" combatant status is far more than simply a matter of semantics. Without any determination of lawful or unlawful status, classification as an \"enemy combatant\" is sufficient to justify a detaining power's continuing detention of an individual captured in battle or taken into custody in the course of ongoing hostilities. However, under the well recognized body of customary international law relating to armed conflict, and specific provisions of GPW III, lawful combatants enjoy \"combatant immunity\"[5] for their precapture acts of warfare, including the targeting, wounding, or killing of other human beings, provided those actions were performed in the context of ongoing hostilities against lawful military targets, and were not in violation of the law of war. See Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 793, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950)(Black, J. dissenting)(\"Legitimate `acts of warfare,' however murderous, do not justify criminal conviction.... It is no `crime' to be a soldier ....\")(citing Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 30-31, 63 S.Ct. 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942)) (\"Mere membership in the armed forces could not under any circumstances create criminal liability....\"); Lindh, 212 F.Supp.2d at 553 (citing Waldemar A. Solf & Edward R. Cummings, A Survey of Penal Sanctions Under Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, 9 Case W. Res. J. Int'l L. 205, 212 (1977)). Lawful enemy combatants enjoy all the privileges afforded soldiers under the law of war, including combatant immunity and the protections of the Geneva Conventions if wounded or sick, and while being held as prisoners of war (POWs).[6] Additionally, lawful enemy combatants facing judicial proceedings for any of their actions in warfare that violate the law of war, or for post-capture offenses committed while they are POWs, are entitled to be tried by the same courts, and in accordance with the same procedures, that the detaining power would utilize to try members of its own armed forces (i.e., by court-martial for lawful enemy combatants held by the United States). See Arts. 84, 87 and 102, GPW III. *1222 Indeed, GPW III codified many existing principles of customary international law and added numerous additional provisions, all aimed at protecting lawful combatants from being punished for their hostile actions prior to capture;[7] ensuring that POWs were treated and cared for humanely upon capture; and seeking to guarantee the general welfare and well-being of POWs during the entire period they remained in captivity. See R.C. Hingorani, Prisoners of War 9 (1982). Accordingly, technical \"crimes\" committed by lawful combatants authorized to use force in the context of ongoing hostilities may not be prosecuted unless those offenses are unrelated to the conflict, or violate the law of war or international humanitarian law. Lindh, 212 F.Supp.2d at 553; See John Cerone, Status of Detainees in International Armed Conflict, and Their Protection in the Course of Criminal Proceedings, The American Society of International Law, Jan. 2002. At the conclusion of the armed conflict, lawful combatants who are held as POWs are entitled to be safely and expeditiously repatriated to their nation of origin.[8] Unlawful combatants, on the other hand, are not entitled to \"combatant immunity\" nor any of the protections generally afforded lawful combatants who become POWs. Unlawful combatants remain civilians and may properly be captured, detained by opposing military forces, and treated as criminals under the domestic law of the capturing nation for any and all unlawful combat actions. Lindh, 212 F.Supp.2d at 554 (citing Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. at 30-31, 63 S.Ct. 2); see Army Op. Law Handbook 17. Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. at 30, 63 S.Ct. 2. M.C.A. § 948b(f) addresses Common Article 3's application, stating, \"A military commission established under this chapter is a regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples' for purposes of [C]ommon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\"[9]*1223 Under the M.C.A., unlawful enemy combatants who engage in hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents, or materially support such, are subject to trial by military commission for violations of the law of war and other offenses made triable by that statute. See §§ 948a(1)(A)(ii) and 948b(a). The burden of raising the special defense that one is entitled to lawful combatant immunity rests upon the individual asserting the claim. Lindh, 212 F.Supp.2d at 557-58. Once raised before a military commission, the burden then shifts to the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense does not exist. R.M.C. 916(b). Determining lawful and unlawful combatant status under existing international treaties, customary international law, case law precedent (both international and domestic), and the M.C.A. is a matter well within the professional capacity of a military judge. It is against this legal backdrop that we now examine the significance of Mr. Khadr's 2004 C.S.R.T. classification as an \"enemy combatant,\" the subsequent referral of criminal charges against him to a military commission, and the military judge's sua sponte dismissal of those charges without prejudice.  Appellant's appeal requires us to address two important issues. First, whether the military judge erred in ruling that Mr. Khadr's September, 2004 C.S.R.T. classification as an \"enemy combatant\" was insufficient to satisfy the congressionally mandated requirement, established in the M.C.A., that military commission jurisdiction shall exist solely over offenses committed by \"alien unlawful enemy combatants,\" see M.C.A. §§ 948c and 948d(a). Second, if we answer the first question negatively, we must determine whether the military judge erred in ruling that neither the military commission nor the military judge were empowered under the M.C.A. to receive evidence, and thereafter assess Mr. Khadr's status as an \"alien unlawful enemy combatant\" for purposes *1224 of determining the commission's criminal jurisdiction over him.  Section 948d of the M.C.A. defines the jurisdictional limits of military commissions stating: (italics added). The military judge in this case dismissed all charges and specifications (without prejudice) against Mr. Khadr based upon his conclusion that the jurisdictional provisions of M.C.A. § 948d had not been met.[11] The judge correctly noted that the M.C.A. appeared to be clear in limiting jurisdiction for trial by military commission solely to unlawful enemy combatants,[12] and excluding from a commission's jurisdiction any lawful enemy combatants, who instead must be tried under the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq.[13] We agree with the military judge that Mr. *1225 Khadr's 2004 C.S.R.T. classification as an \"enemy combatant\" failed to meet the M.C.A.'s jurisdictional requirements in that it did not establish that Mr. Khadr was in fact an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" to satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite for trial by military commission. Under M.C.A. § 948c, only an \"alien unlawful enemy combatant is subject to trial by military commission.\" The M.C.A., in § 948a(1)(A), defines \"unlawful enemy combatant\" as follows: Appellant contends Mr. Khadr's designation as an \"enemy combatant\" by his C.S.R.T. in 2004 was itself sufficient to establish the military commission's jurisdiction and that the military judge erred in ruling otherwise. In its motion asking the military judge to reconsider his dismissal action, Appellant argued that the judge failed to give proper consideration and deference to a White House memorandum signed by President Bush in February 2002[15] which, in Appellant's view, declared all members of the Taliban and al Qaeda to be \"unlawful combatants\" under the Geneva Conventions. See Prosecution Motion for Reconsideration of June 8, 2007 at 4-6; see also Brief on Behalf of Appellant at 5 ¶ c. Appellant makes a similar argument regarding a July 2004 memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense (then Mr. Paul Wolfowitz) to the Secretary of the Navy establishing the procedures to be employed for C.S.R.T.'s, and summarily declaring: According to Appellant, Congress enacted the M.C.A. \"fully aware\" of the 2002 White House memorandum and the 2004 Wolfowitz memorandum, including the definitional provisions and declarations contained in both. Appellant argues that it was the \"clear intent\" of Congress to adopt the memoranda's categorical declarations of combatant status regarding members of the Taliban and al Qaeda, and that C.S.R.T. determinations of \"enemy combatant\" status made prior to the adoption of the M.C.A. are sufficient to establish military commission jurisdiction. See Brief on Behalf of Appellant at 11-14. To *1226 buttress these assertions, Appellant has directed us to R.M.C. 202(b), which discusses in personam military commission jurisdiction and declares, \"[a] finding, whether before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, by a [C.S.R.T.] or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant is dispositive for purposes of jurisdiction for trial by a military commission under the M.C.A.\" Appellant also highlights the following statement contained in the nonbinding Discussion to R.M.C. 202 regarding C.S.R.T. determinations: From the President's 2002 White House memorandum, the 2004 Wolfowitz memorandum, and this nonbinding Discussion to R.M.C. 202, we are now asked to categorically equate the administration's prior pronouncements regarding members of the Taliban and al Qaeda, and use of the term \"enemy combatant\" throughout the C.S.R.T. process, with \"unlawful enemy combatant\" as defined in the M.C.A., and attribute that extrapolation to the \"clear intent\" of Congress. In this regard, Appellant invites us to interpret the parenthetical language contained in M.C.A. § 948a(1)(A)(i)\"including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces\"as evidence that \"Congress statutorily ratified the President's prior determination\" and that \"[t]his crucial parenthetical established, as a matter of statute, that a member of al Qaeda or the Talibanwithout moreis an `unlawful enemy combatant' who can be tried by military commission.\" Supplemental Brief on Behalf of Appellant at 5. In light of the plain language of the M.C.A., and applying common logic and reasoning, we decline to accept the Appellant's position. We believe the Congress, well aware of the fact that \"trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure,\" see Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 567, 126 S.Ct. at 2759, 165 L.Ed.2d at 738-39 (citing Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 19, 63 S.Ct. 1, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942)), was abundantly clear in precisely establishing the jurisdictional prerequisites it intended to mandate prior to any criminal proceeding before such a commission could occur. As with all matters of statutory interpretation, we look first and foremost to the language contained in the statute itself. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 172, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In doing so, we give the words contained in the text their ordinary meaning and interpret the statute in a manner that does not render words or phrases superfluous, unless no other reasonable interpretation can be made.[17] It is unequivocally clear to us from the plain language *1227 of the M.C.A. that Congress intended trials by military commission to be utilized solely and exclusively to try only \"alien unlawful enemy combatants.\" The M.C.A.'s jurisdictional provisions (§§ 948c and 948d) and definitions section (§ 948a(1)(A)(i)) make this intent perfectly clear. So also does the M.C.A.'s express admonition in § 948d(b) that military commissions \"shall not have jurisdiction to try a lawful enemy combatant.\" Congress further stated that a C.S.R.T.'s (or other competent tribunal's) determination that a person is an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" would be dispositive for purposes of establishing jurisdiction for trial by military commission. See M.C.A. § 948d(c).[18] No such statement is made regarding a prior designation of a detainee as simply an \"enemy combatant\" and, in our opinion, such designation is not useful in resolving this ultimate issue of criminal jurisdiction under the M.C.A. Congress was undoubtedly aware of the White House (2002) and Wolfowitz (2004) memoranda when they wrote and enacted the M.C.A. in 2006. This is yet another case where \"Congress, in the proper exercise of its powers as an independent branch of government, and as part of a long tradition of legislative involvement in matters of military justice, has considered the subject of military tribunals and set limits on the President's authority. Where a statute provides the conditions for the exercise of governmental power, its requirements are the result of a deliberative and reflective process engaging both of the political branches.\" Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 636-37, 126 S.Ct. at 2799, 165 L.Ed.2d at 781 (Kennedy J., concurring). Had Congress intended prior designations of detainees as mere \"enemy combatants\" to be sufficient to establish military commission jurisdiction, it was fully capable of saying this in the legislation. It did not. Indeed, neither the White House nor Wolfowitz memoranda are ever referenced in the M.C.A. In our opinion, Congress, clearly aware of the previously troubled military commission processand armed with affirmative guidance from the Supreme Court provided in the June, 2006 decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeldsought to enact new, clear, and unequivocal legislation to unambiguously guide and successfully implement trials by military commissions.[19] *1228 We find no support for Appellant's claim that Congress, through the M.C.A., created a \"comprehensive system\" which sought to embrace and adopt all prior C.S.R.T. determinations that resulted in \"enemy combatant\" status assignments, and summarily turn those designations into findings that persons so labeled could also properly be considered \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" Similarly, we find no support for Appellant's position regarding the parenthetical language contained in § 948a(1)(A)(i) of the M.C.A.\"including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces.\" We do not read this language as declaring that a member of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces is per se an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction before a military commission. We read the parenthetical comment as simply elaborating upon the sentence immediately preceding it. That is, that a member of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents will also qualify as an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" under the M.C.A. (emphasis added). This interpretation is consistent with § 948b of the M.C.A., which describes the general purpose of military commissions as existing \"to try alien unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the United States for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission.\" (italics added). Critical to this analysis is the understanding that unlike the White House and Wolfowitz memoranda, both of which declared \"enemy combatant\" status solely for purposes of continued detention of personnel captured during hostilities and applicability of the Geneva ConventionsCongress in the M.C.A. was carefully and deliberately defining status for the express purpose of specifying the in personam criminal jurisdiction of military commission trials. In defining what was clearly intended to be limited jurisdiction, Congress also prescribed serious criminal sanctions for those members of this select group who were ultimately convicted by military commissions.[20] Contrary to the claims in Appellant's briefs, the 2002 White House memorandum never affirmatively declared members of al Qaeda to be \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" In the memorandum, the President simply stated, \"I also accept the legal conclusion of the Department of Justice and determine that none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al Qaeda in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world because, among other reasons, al Qaeda is not a High Contracting Party to *1229 Geneva.\" White House memorandum at 1, ¶ 2a. The memorandum later states that \"because Geneva does not apply to our conflict with al Qaeda, al Qaeda detainees... do not qualify as prisoners of war.\" Id. at 2, ¶ 2d. It is reasonable to assume that Congress would seek to affirmatively declare the circumstances under which individual members of al Qaeda could become \"unlawful enemy combatants\" for purposes of exacting criminal liability under the M.C.A. Limiting criminal responsibility solely to an individual (including a member of al Qaeda or the Taliban, or associated forces) who actually \"engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents\" appears to be the clear intent of Congress, and requires more than mere membership in an organization for criminal responsibility to attach.[21] Regarding the Taliban, the 2002 White House memorandum pronounced \"the provisions of Geneva will apply to our present conflict with the Taliban.\" Id. at ¶ 2b. However, it then declared that \"the Taliban detainees are unlawful combatants and, therefore, do not qualify as prisoners of war under Article 4 of Geneva.\" Id. at ¶ 2d. This decision was based upon the Taliban's failure to comply with fundamental law of war requirements.[22] Again, Congress, clearly aware of this language, appears to have decided that only a Taliban member who actually \"engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents\" should be subject to trial by military commission. To accept Appellant's interpretation would allow criminal jurisdiction at a military commission to attach to members of the Taliban or al Qaeda who had never engaged in or supported hostilities. Finally, the 2002 White House memorandum concluded that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions \"does not apply to either al Qaeda or Taliban detainees.\" Id. at ¶ 2c. The Supreme Court subsequently determined that legal conclusion was erroneous. See Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 629-30, 126 S.Ct. at 2795-96, 165 L.Ed.2d at 776-78.[23] Congress, clearly aware of the Hamdan decision when it drafted the *1230 M.C.A., appears to have embraced the minimal safeguards guaranteed by Common Article 3 requiring that even \"unlawful enemy combatants\" be tried by a \"regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\" See § 948b(f), M.C.A. (quoting Common Article 3\"A military commission established under this chapter is a regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples' for purposes of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions\"); see also Art. III, GPW III, ¶ 1(d). No serious legal authority would contest the notion that one of the most indispensable and important judicial guarantees among civilized nations honoring a tradition of due process and fundamental fairness is the right to adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in regard to allegations which might result in criminal sanctions.[24] The M.C.A. did not exist until October 2006. Mr. Khadr could not have known at the time of his C.S.R.T. in 2004 that a determination of \"enemy combatant\" status pursuant to declarations contained in the 2002 White House memorandum, or definitions contained in the 2004 Wolfowitz memorandum, could dispositively qualify him two years after the fact for potential criminal liability before a military commission as an \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" We need not speculate how Mr. Khadr's personal participation in his 2004 C.S.R.T. evaluation may have been impacted had he been on notice of the potential criminal liability the C.S.R.T.'s findings could impose upon him. Such lack of notice offends our most basic and fundamental notions of due process; therefore, it also violates Common Article 3. The declared purpose of the C.S.R.T. process used to review the status of hundreds of foreign national detainees captured in Iraq and Afghanistan and currently held under Defense Department control at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cubaincluding Mr. Khadrwas solely to afford detainees \"the opportunity to contest designation as an enemy combatant.\" Wolfowitz memorandum at 1. The Wolfowitz memorandum never discusses addressing the issue of \"lawful\" or \"unlawful\" enemy combatant status; nor does the memorandum from the Secretary of the Navy implementing the C.S.R.T. process.[25]*1231 As far as we can discern, the C.S.R.T.s were never tasked with making that determination. Instead, they conducted non-adversarial proceedings aimed at deciding, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether each detainee met the criteria for designation as an \"enemy combatant\" under the definition in the Wolfowitz memorandum[26] to permit continued detention at Guantanamo Bay. Id. at 2. In doing so, Mr. Khadr's 2004 C.S.R.T. employed a less exacting standard than that contained in the M.C.A. for establishing \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status. A detainee could be classified as an \"enemy combatant\" under the C.S.R.T. definition simply by being a \"part of\" the Taliban or al Qaeda, without ever having engaged in or supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. Id. While such a classification would certainly be appropriate for authorizing continued detention during ongoing hostilities, it does not address in any way the \"lawful\" or \"unlawful\" nature of the detained combatant's belligerency under the M.C.A. Congress never stated that mere membership in or affiliation with the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces was a sufficient basis for declaring someone to be an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction over that person.[27] In the M.C.A., military commission jurisdiction is limited solely to those who actually \"engaged in hostilities or who ... purposefully and materially supported hostilities....\" See § 948a(1)(A)(i)(emphasis added). While Mr. Khadr's C.S.R.T. may have had more than sufficient evidence before it to properly classify him as an \"alien unlawful enemy combatant,\" it was not charged with making that determination, and could not have applied the definition established by Congress, as it did not come into existence until October 2006two years later. We will apply the clear and unambiguous jurisdictional language Congress provided in the M.C.A. Doing so, we affirm the military judge's conclusion that Mr. Khadr's C.S.R.T. classification in 2004 as an \"enemy combatant\" was insufficient to establish the military commission's criminal jurisdiction over him.  We next examine the military judge's determination that \"the military commission is not the proper authority, under the provisions of the M.C.A., to determine that Mr. Khadr is an unlawful enemy combatant in order to establish initial jurisdiction for this commission to try Mr. Khadr.\" See Military Judge's Order on Jurisdiction of June 4 2007 at 1-2; Record at 21. A brief chronology of the procedural evolution of this military commission illuminates the judge's ultimate ruling:   After ruling that Mr. Khadr's C.S.R.T. classification as an \"enemy combatant\" was insufficient to establish the military commission's jurisdiction over him, the military judge went on to conclude that he was not empowered to independently decide the matter of in personam jurisdiction because \"the M.C.A. requires [that] determination be made in advance for there to be jurisdiction to refer charges against the accused. This is what Congress directed, and the Military Judge lacks authority to ignore this mandate.\" Disposition of Prosecution Motion for Reconsideration (AE 23) at 4, ¶ (3)(a). After affirmatively concluding that neither he nor the military commission was authorized to render a determination on Mr. Khadr's \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status,[29] and that such a determination had to be made as a prerequisite to referral, the military judge faulted Appellant for not presenting proof at the military commission hearing of Mr. Khadr's unlawful enemy combatant status, or requesting a continuance to more thoroughly brief the issue. Id. at ¶¶ 3a(3) & 3b(1)-(3). In his ruling, he also categorically rejected \"the implication that the prosecution was not allowed to present argument or evidence on jurisdiction.\" Id. at ¶ 3b. \"He then decided that the Military Commission did not have jurisdiction.\" Id. at ¶ 4a.[30] We hold the military judge erred in two respects: first, in not affording Appellant the opportunity to present evidence in support of its position on the jurisdictional issue before the military commission; and second, in concluding that a C.S.R.T. (or another competent tribunal) determination of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status was a prerequisite to referral of charges to a military commission, and that the military commission lacked the power to independently consider and decide this important jurisdictional matter under the M.C.A.  We review a military judge's decision in regard to admitting or excluding evidence utilizing an \"abuse of discretion\" standard. United States v. Billings, *1233 61 M.J. 163, 166 (C.A.A.F.2005); see also General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 139, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). \"The abuse of discretion standard of review recognizes that a judge has a range of choices [in such matters] and will not be reversed so long as the decision remains within that range.\" United States v. Gore, 60 M.J. 178, 187 (C.A.A.F.2004)(citing United States v. Wallace, 964 F.2d 1214, 1217 n. 3 (D.C.Cir. 1992)); United States v. McCollum, 58 M.J. 323, 335 (C.A.A.F.2003). Applying this standard is also appropriate in reviewing a judge's decisions regarding evidence production during a motion hearing or at trial. Both the record of trial and the military judge's actions and rulings in this case demonstrate that the prosecution was not afforded the opportunity to present evidence to establish the military commission's in personam jurisdiction over Mr. Khadr. Although the assistant prosecutor argued the military commission should interpret Mr. Khadr's 2004 C.S.R.T. \"enemy combatant\" classification as satisfying the M.C.A's jurisdictional language, he also articulated a clear alternative position on the record. See Record at 11-13. Record at 12.[31] The assistant prosecutor then specifically listed the evidence the Government would present in support of Mr. Khadr's \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status, which, inter alia, included a videotape of Mr. Khadr \"engaged in unlawful combat activities including wearing civilian attire and making and planting roadside bombs,\" admissions made by Mr. Khadr, and other statements that implicated him in conducting such unlawful activities. Record at 12.[32] The military judge did not allow the government to present their evidence and instead inquired whether \"anyone thought about going back and doing new [combatant status] review tribunals.\" Record at 17. Then, after a very brief recess, the military judge immediately announced his ruling on his own sua sponte motion, and dismissed the charges without prejudice. Record at 22. We disagree with the military judge's statement in his ruling on the Motion for Reconsideration \"that the prosecution did not make a formal offer of proof concerning any of the evidence which it now proposes be used.\" Disposition of Prosecution Motion for Reconsideration (AE 23) at 3, ¶ 3b(1). The record demonstrates Appellant offered and was ready to present evidence to affirmatively establish the military commission's jurisdiction over Mr. Khadr, but was summarily denied that opportunity. The record does not support the assertion that the military judge afforded the prosecution an opportunity to present evidence on the jurisdiction and that they failed to do so. Asking counsel whether they have \"anything else to say\" *1234 in oral argument upon a pending motion is not the equivalent of an invitation or offer to present evidence. Id. at ¶ 3b(3); see e.g., Record at 15-16. Indeed, oral argument upon a motion should rarely take place at all prior to evidence regarding the factual matters in dispute first being adduced at the motion hearing.[33] Finally, if there was any genuine confusion on this matter at the initial session of Mr. Khadr's military commission, Appellant's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration made it clear the prosecution \"was and remains fully prepared to present evidence that would clearly establish jurisdiction over the accused.\" Prosecution Motion for Reconsideration of June 8, 2007 at 7. For these reasons, and those addressed in the next section of this opinion, we find the military judge abused his discretion in deciding this critical jurisdictional matter without first fully considering both the admissibility and merits of evidence Appellant offered to present on this issue.  We also conclude that the military judge erred in ruling he lacked authority under the M.C.A. to determine whether Mr. Khadr is an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" for purposes of establishing the military commission's initial jurisdiction to try him. See Military Judge's \"Order on Jurisdiction\" of June 4, 2007 at 1-2; Record at 21. The unambiguous language of the M.C.A., in conjunction with a clear and compelling line of federal precedent on the issue of establishing jurisdiction in federal courts, convince us the military judge possessed the independent authority to decide this critical jurisdictional prerequisite. \"[A] federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.\" United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 627, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002). A military commission is no different. See R.M.C. 201(b)(3)(\"A military commission always has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction.\"). The military judge expressly acknowledged in his ruling upon the Motion for Reconsideration, \"there is no express statutory directive that the government must establish jurisdiction before it is allowed to proceed with a Military Commission.\" See Disposition of Prosecution Motion for Reconsideration at 6, ¶ 4e(3). Nevertheless, the military judge concluded there were \"clear and unambiguous indicia that Congress intended ... initial jurisdiction be established before the mechanism set up by the M.C.A. was used in the case of a given person[.]\" Id. He concluded the only avenue for establishing initial jurisdiction was through a prior determination of \"unlawful enemy combatant status by a C.S.R.T. (or other competent tribunal).\" Id. at 7, ¶ 4e(3)(c). While we agree with the military judge's view that Congress contemplated an initial assessment of an accused's \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status prior to referral of charges to a military commission, we disagree with his conclusion that the only avenue for the assessment is that delineated in M.C.A. § 948a(1)(A)(ii). See M.C.A. § 948a-d. As previously noted, any alien unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents is subject to trial by military commission for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission. See M.C.A. § 948a-d; R.M.C. 201(b)(1). This jurisdiction attaches upon the formal swearing of charges against an accused, after an individual subject to the *1235 Uniform Code of Military Justice avers under formal oath that the charges are \"true in fact.\" See R.M.C. 202(c) and 307(b). Charges may then be referred for trial by military commission under R.M.C. 601 as long as \"reasonable grounds [exist] to believe that an offense triable by a military commission has been committed and that the accused committed it.\" R.M.C. 601(d). The only relevant limitation upon referral of charges is the requirement in R.M.C. 406(b) that, inter alia, prior to referral, the charge(s) must be referred to the convening authority's legal officer for pretrial advice, and that individual must state his/her conclusion as to \"whether a military commission would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offense.\" See R.M.C. 406(b)(3). All of these steps occurred in this case, and, as previously stated, each offense referred for trial against Mr. Khadr clearly alleges the express jurisdictional language used in the M.C.A., that he is \"a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant.\" AE 1 at 4-7 (emphasis added). We find that this facial compliance by the Government with all the pre-referral criteria contained in the Rules for Military Commissions, combined with an unambiguous allegation in the pleadings that Mr. Khadr is \"a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant,\" entitled the military commission to initially and properly exercise prima facie personal jurisdiction over the accused until such time as that jurisdiction was challenged by a motion to dismiss for lack thereof, or proof of jurisdiction was lacking on the merits. In our opinion, the M.C.A. is clear and deliberate in its creation of a bifurcated methodology for establishing an accused's \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status so as to permit that individual's trial before a military commission. These two methods are laid out in M.C.A. § 948a(1)(A) where an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" is defined as: (emphasis added). The disjunctive \"or\" between subsections (i) and (ii) clearly sets forth alternative approaches for establishing military commission jurisdiction. See In re Espy, 80 F.3d 501, 505 (D.C.Cir.1996)(\"`[c]anons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings,' and a statute written in the disjunctive is generally construed as `setting out separate and distinct alternatives.'\")(quoting Reiter v. Sonotone Corporation, 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979)). The military judge did not apply the disjunctive separation of these two provisions, and erroneously interpreted the distinct provisions as if written in the conjunctive; that is, as if joined by the word \"and\" rather than \"or.\"[34] Such an *1236 interpretation would render subsection (i) nothing more than a definition in aid of a C.S.R.T. (or other competent tribunal) determination of combatant status under subsection (ii), and is contradictory to the statute's clear structure, wording, and overall intent. Upon challenge, the first method by which the M.C.A. contemplates jurisdiction being established is by evidence being presented before the military judge factually establishing that an accused meets the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" as contained in subsection (i). In personam criminal jurisdiction over a criminal accused is generally a question of law to be decided by the military judge, and is usually resolved only after presentation of evidence supporting jurisdiction and entry of corresponding findings of fact. See United States v. Melanson, 53 M.J. 1, 2 (C.A.A.F.2000)(\"When an accused contests personal jurisdiction on appeal, we review that question of law de novo, accepting the military judge's findings of historical facts unless they are clearly erroneous or unsupported in the record.\"); United States v. Ernest, 32 M.J. 135, 136-37 (C.M.A.1991)(twenty-four findings of fact entered by the trial court in determining whether to grant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction); United States v. Cline, 26 M.J. 1005, 1007 (A.F.C.M.R.1988)(returning record to trial court to more fully develop and analyze factual matters serving as basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction); see also United States v. Anderson, 472 F.3d 662, 666-67 (9th Cir.2006)(determining personal jurisdiction in light of alleged violation of extradition treaty). There is a long and well-developed tradition in U.S. federal courts and, specifically, throughout military court-martial jurisprudence of military judges deciding matters of personal jurisdiction. See e.g., Solorio, 483 U.S. at 439, 450-51, 107 S.Ct. 2924 (listing military cases where personal jurisdiction litigated); J. Horbaly, Court-Martial Jurisdiction 375-534 (1986)(unpublished dissertation, Yale Law School)(listing numerous cases involving court-martial litigation to determine jurisdiction); Department of the Army Pamphlet 27-173, Legal Services Trial Procedure 40-112 (Dec. 31, 2002). Congress, clearly aware of historical courtmartial practice, and desiring that military commissions mirror this firmly rooted practice to the maximum extent practicable,[35] would not have deprived military commissions of the ability to independently decide personal jurisdiction absent an express statement of such intent. No such statement is contained anywhere in the M.C.A. The military judge's reliance on M.C.A. § 948a(1)(A)(ii) for the proposition that a military commission itself cannot determine personal jurisdiction is misplaced. This provision supports Appellant's position rather than detracts from it. Although Congress assigned a jurisdictional \"safe harbor\" for prior C.S.R.T. (or other competent tribunal) determinations of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status by statutorily deeming them \"dispositive\" of jurisdiction, it did not in any way preclude Appellant from proving jurisdiction before the military commission in the absence of such a determination. Indeed, the existence of a statutorily recognized path to *1237 achieve a \"dispositive\" determination of jurisdiction suggests that pretrial procedures and pleadings alleging jurisdiction should simply be viewed as \"nondispositive.\"[36] Subsection (ii) does not eliminate traditional methods of proving jurisdiction before the commission itself. We agree with Appellant's suggestion that Congress, through subsection (ii), merely carved out an exception to the military commission's authority to itself determine jurisdictional matters. See Supplemental Brief on Behalf of Appellant at 12. As Appellant notes, subsection (ii) makes it clear that the military judge is not at liberty to revisit a C.S.R.T.'s (or other competent tribunal's) finding of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status when there is such a finding. See Appellant's Supplemental Brief in Response to Court's Request at Oral Argument at 7. However, nothing in the M.C.A. requires such a finding in order to establish military commission jurisdiction. Had they so intended, Congress could have clearly stated in the M.C.A. that the only way to establish military commission jurisdiction is through a prior C.S.R.T. (or other competent tribunal) determination of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status. It did not. Accordingly, we may properly findas clearly indicated in the language of M.C.A. §§ 949a(a) and 948b(c)that Congress intended for military commissions to \"apply the principles of law\" and \"the procedures for trial [routinely utilized] by general courts-martial....\" This would include the common procedures used before general courts-martial permitting military judges to hear evidence and decide factual and legal matters concerning the court's own jurisdiction over the accused appearing before it. This view is supported in the Rules for Military Commissions, which provide exactly such procedures. R.M.C. 907(b) allows an accused to raise a \"Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction,\" and recognizes lack of jurisdiction as a nonwaivable ground for dismissal of charges at any stage of the proceedings. R.M.C. 905c(2)(B) assigns the burden of persuasion to the prosecution on a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction; R.M.C. 905c(1) sets that burden on any factual issue necessary to resolve the motion as \"a preponderance of the evidence.\" Clearly, these rules contemplate potential litigation of personal jurisdictional issues by the military commission, and provide the procedures necessary to address such a challenge.[37] If the only avenue to achieve military commission jurisdiction was through a previously rendered C.S.R.T. (or *1238 other competent tribunal) determination of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status, all of these rules would be superfluous, as \"dispositive\" jurisdiction would have attached before the fact. The text, structure, and history of the M.C.A. demonstrate clearly that a military judge presiding over a military commission may determine both the factual issue of an accused's \"unlawful enemy combatant status\" and the corresponding legal issue of the military commission's in personam jurisdiction. A contrary interpretation would ignore the bifurcated structure of M.C.A. § 948(1)(A) and the long-standing history of military judges in general courts-martial finding jurisdictional facts by a preponderance of the evidence, and resolving pretrial motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The M.C.A. identifies two potential jurisdiction-establishing methodologies based upon an allegation of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status. The first, reflected in § 948a(1)(A)(i), involves the clear delineation of the jurisdictional standard to be applied by a military commission in determining its own jurisdiction. The second, contained in § 948a(1)(A)(ii), involves a non-judicial related jurisdictional determination that is to be afforded \"dispositive\" deference by the military commission. Either method will allow the military commission's exercise of jurisdiction where \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status has been established by a preponderance of the evidence. This interpretation is consistent with the requirements of both the M.C.A. and with international law.[38]See Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118, 2 L.Ed. 208 (1804)(acts of Congress will generally be construed in a manner so as not to violate international law, as we presume that Congress ordinarily seeks to comply with international law when legislating). Because we find the military judge had the power and authority under subsection (i) of § 948a(1)(A) of the M.C.A. to hear evidence concerning, and to ultimately decide, Mr. Khadr's \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status, we need not address whether or not a military commission is \"another competent tribunal\" under subsection (ii) to make that decision.  The military judge's ruling he lacked authority to hear evidence on, and ultimately decide, the matter of Mr. Khadr's \"unlawful enemy combatant status\" under the provisions of the M.C.A. is reversed. The record of trial is returned to the military judge, who shall, consistent with this opinion, conduct all proceedings necessary to determine the military commission's jurisdiction over Mr. Khadr. Judge FRANCIS and Judge HOLDEN concur. [1]  Mr. Edney and Mr. Whitling are both admitted to the bar in Canada and, upon motion, were authorized to appear as counsel for Mr. Khadr's appeal to argue pro hac vice pursuant to Rule 8(f) of our Rules of Practice.

[3]  The military judge's ruling became final for purposes of the notice provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 950d(a)(2), (b) on June 29, 2007, the day the military judge denied Appellant's Motion for Reconsideration.

[4]  The United States is a signatory nation to all four Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions are generally viewed as self-executing treaties (i.e., ones which become effective without the necessity of implementing congressional action), form a part of American law, and are binding in federal courts under the Supremacy Clause. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2 (\"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land. . . .\"). United States v. Lindh, 212 F.Supp.2d 541, 553-54 (E.D.Va.2002) (citing United States v. Noriega, 808 F.Supp. 791, 796 (S.D.Fla.1992)). The Geneva Conventions stand preeminent among the major treaties on the law of war. See Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006)(citing \"Geneva\" 123 times in the opinion). The Geneva Conventions have been acceded to by 194 states. International Committee of the Red Cross, available at http:// www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteengO.nsf/htmlall/ genevaconventions. The United States implemented the Geneva Conventions via 18 U.S.C. § 2441, Pub. L. No. 104-192, 110 Stat. 2104 (1996). [5]  Also referred to as \"belligerent privilege.\" [6]  Lindh, 212 F.Supp.2d at 553-54; see also U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School, Dept. of the Army, Operational Law Handbook 16 (2006)(hereinafter Army Op. Law Handbook). [7]  See e.g., GPW III, Article 87 (\"[POWs] may not be sentenced by the military authorities and courts of the Detaining Power to any penalties except those provided for in respect of members of the armed force of the said Power who have committed the same acts.\") and Article 99 (\"No [POW] may be tried or sentenced for an act which is not forbidden by the law of the Detaining Power or by international law, in force at the time the said act was committed.\"). These two Articles, when read together, have been interpreted to \"make clear that a belligerent in war cannot prosecute the soldiers of its foes for the soldiers' lawful acts of war.\" Lindh, 212 F.Supp.2d at 553. [8]  See Articles 118 and 119, GPW III. [9]  Article 3, GPWan Article common to all four Geneva Conventionssuggests that even unlawful combatants are entitled to be tried in a \"regularly constituted court.\" The Supreme Court in Hamdan explained:\n",
            " Common Article 3, then, is applicable here and, ... requires that Hamdan be tried by a \"regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people.\" 6 U.S.T., at 3320 (Art. 3, ¶ 1(d)). While the term \"regularly constituted court\" is not specifically defined in either Common Article 3 or its accompanying commentary, other sources have disclosed its core meaning. The commentary accompanying [Article 66 of the Fourth Geneva Convention] defines \"`regularly constituted'\" tribunals to include \"ordinary military courts\" and \"definitely exclude[e] all special tribunals.\" GCIV Commentary 340 (defining the term \"properly constituted\" in Article 66, which the commentary treats as \"regularly constituted\"); see also [In re] Yamashita, 327 U.S. [1], at 44, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 [(1946)] (Rutledge, J., dissenting)(describing military commission as a court \"specially constituted for a particular trial\"). And one of the Red Cross' own treatises defines \"regularly constituted court\" as used in Common Article 3 to mean \"established and organized in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country.\" Int'l Comm. of Red Cross, 1 Customary International Humanitarian Law 355 (2005); see also GCIV Commentary 340 (observing that \"ordinary military courts\" will \"be set up in accordance with the recognized principles governing the administration of justice\"). Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 631-32, 126 S.Ct. at 2797-98, 165 L.Ed.2d at 778. Justices Breyer, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg agreed in Hamdan, that those military commissions which generally adopt the structure and procedure of courts-martial, and are \"conducted[] similarly to courts-martial\" are regularly constituted military courts under United States law. Hamdan, 126 S.Ct. at 2803-04 (Souter, J., concurring in result). Notably, Justices Thomas, Alito, and Scalia agreed that the military commission at issue in Hamdan was a \"regularly constituted tribunal\" under Common Article 3, despite being substantially dissimilar from courts-martial. 548 U.S. at 725-30, 126 S.Ct. at 2850-52, 165 L.Ed.2d at 836-38 (Alito, J., dissenting). \"If `special' means anything in contradistinction to `regular,' it would be in the sense of `special' as `relating to a single thing,' and `regular' as `uniform in course, practice or occurrence.'

[11]  R.M.C. 201(b)(3) sets forth the specific requisites for military commission jurisdiction, which include:\n",
            " (a) The military commission must be convened by an official empowered to convene it; (b) The military commission must be composed in accordance with these rules with respect to number and qualifications of its personnel. As used here, \"personnel\" includes only the military judge and the members. (c) Each charge before the military commission must be referred to it by a competent authority; (d) The accused must be a person subject to military commission jurisdiction; and (e) The offense must be subject to military commission jurisdiction. [12]  See M.C.A. § 948d(a). Mr. Khadr's status as an \"alien\" is not in dispute. [13]  See M.C.A. § 948d(b)(lawful combatants who violate the law of war are subject to the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice; courts-martial shall have jurisdiction to try lawful combatants for any offense made punishable under the M.C.A.).

Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001)(\"It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant\")(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917)(if a statute's language is plain and clear, \"the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms\"). [18]  Though Congress intended to create a \"safe harbor\" for C.S.R.T. determinations made prior to and after the M.C.A.'s enactment, this provision cannot be used to transform an \"enemy combatant\" designation made for one purpose into a declaration of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status for another. From the M.C.A.'s language, this \"safe harbor\" exists only for previously made \"unlawful enemy combatant\" designations (italics added). Congress intended that properly made individual C.S.R.T. determinations of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status established by a preponderance of the evidence should be afforded great deference by the military commission. See R.M.C. 905(c)(1), 2(B). For purposes of resolving this Government appeal, we need not determine whether this \"dispositive jurisdiction\" provision deprives a military commission accused of a critical \"judicial guarantee[] ... recognized as indispensable by civilized people\" under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (i.e., the right to affirmatively challenge the commission's in personam jurisdiction over him). [19]  The Supreme Court determined that the military commissions deviated substantially from regular court-martial practice without an adequate demonstration that procedures more similar to courts-martial were not practicable. Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 623-26, 126 S.Ct. at 2792-93, 165 L.Ed.2d at 773-74. Article 36, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 836 required either uniformity or justification for variation from UCMJ procedures, rendering those military commissions variations illegal. Id. The Court noted, \"Prior to enactment of Article 36(b), [UCMJ] it may well have been the case that a deviation from the rules governing courts-martial would not have rendered the military commission \"illegal.\"\" Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 625 n. 54, 126 S.Ct. at 2793 n. 54, 165 L.Ed.2d at 774 n. 54 (citations omitted). The M.C.A. 948b(d) explicitly ended the applicability of Article 36, UCMJ, to military commission proceedings stating:\n",
            " (d) INAPPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. (1) The following provisions of this title shall not apply to trial by military commission under this chapter: (A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any rule of courts-martial relating to speedy trial. (B) Sections 831(a), (b), and (d) (articles 31(a), (b), and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to compulsory self-incrimination. (C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation. (2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only to the extent provided by this chapter. [20]  See § 948d(d) (a military commission may adjudge any penalty up to and including death, when authorized under the M.C.A. or the law of war). [21]  Summary determinations of a group's unlawful combatant status would appear to violate the Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 533, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004), which recognized the fundamental right to notice and an opportunity to be heard on matters affecting a detainee's \"enemy combatant\" status determination. In Hamdi, Justice Souter suggested that U.S. Army regulations governing combatant status determinations, which were premised upon Article 5 of GPW III, would appear to preclude any \"categorical pronouncement\" regarding an individual's combatant status. Id. at 550, 124 S.Ct. 2633 (Souter, J., concurring); see also Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004); § 948d(c) M.C.A. (requiring that \"unlawful enemy combatant\" statusin order to be \"dispositive\" of jurisdictionbe established by \"a C.S.R.T. or another competent tribunal\"); see Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2739, § 1005. Appellant appears to concede the necessity of individualized combatant status determinations. See Reply Brief on Behalf of Appellant at 16. [22]  See Press Release, White House Office of the Press Sec'y, White House Press Secretary Announcement of President Bush's Determination re Legal Status of Taliban and al Qaeda Detainees (February 7, 2002), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/38727.htm (\"The Taliban have not effectively distinguished themselves from the civilian population of Afghanistan. Moreover, they have not conducted their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war. Instead, they have knowingly adopted and provided support to the unlawful terrorist objectives of the al Qaeda.\"). [23]  The Supreme Court in Hamdan found that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions was applicable to the conflict with al Qaeda because it was a \"conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties.\" Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 629, 126 S.Ct. at 2795, 165 L.Ed.2d at 776 (quoting Common Article 3). Among the minimal protections provided by Common Article 3 is the prohibition against \"the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\" 6 U.S.T. at 3320 (Art. 3 at P1(d)); Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 630, 126 S.Ct. at 2797, 165 L.Ed.2d at 779 (Stevens, J., concurring). The plurality opinion in Hamdan postulated that a regularly constituted court \"must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of those trial protections that have been recognized by customary international law.\" Id.; see also Jack M. Beard, The Geneva Boomerang: The Military Commissions Act of 2006 and U.S. Counterterror Operations, Am. Jour. Int'l L. 58 (2006). [24]  Article 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 articulates many of the fundamental guarantees \"which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\" See Protocol I, Art. 75(4)(a)-(j). Although the United States has declined to ratify Protocol I as a whole, Article 75 has been accepted by our government \"as an articulation of safeguards to which all persons in the hands of an enemy are entitled.\" Hamdan, at 633, 126 S.Ct. at 2797, 165 L.Ed.2d at 779 (quoting Taft, The Law of Armed Conflict After 9/11; Some Salient Features, 28 Yale J. Int'l L. 319, 322 (2003))(Stevens, J., concurring). Among the many rights set forth in Article 75 are notice and \"opportunity to be heard\" provisions. See Protocol I, Art. 75(4)(a) and (g). [25]  See Secretary of the Navy memorandum of July 29, 2004 (\"Implementation of Combatant Status Review Tribunal procedures for Enemy Combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba\"), AE 21 at 1. [26]  Id. at Enclosure (1), ¶ B (An \"enemy combatant\" for purposes of this order shall mean an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of \"enemy armed forces.\"). [27]  See Protocol I, Art. 4(b)(\"no one shall be convicted of an offense except on the basis of individual penal responsibility\"). [28]  R.M.C. 802 authorizes the military judge to conduct pretrial conferences with the parties to \"consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial.\" [29]  The military judge expressly stated in his written disposition of the prosecution's Motion for Reconsideration that, \"In this case, the prosecution was alerted [by the military judge] well ahead of time that it was going to be required to state in open court that there was a C.S.R.T. determination that the accused was an alien unlawful enemy combatant. Such a determination was not presented.\" Id. at ¶ 3. [30]  See also id. at ¶ f(7) where the judge concluded, \"The Military Judge does not find that the Commission is a competent tribunal to establish initial jurisdiction.\" [31]  See also Record at 15, \"... the government would be willing to prove before the military commission that he is, in fact, an unlawful enemy combatant. And if the court is not willing to move forward without a jurisdictional determination, then we are willing to produce evidence proving his status today.\" [32]  Mil. Comm. R. Evidence 104(a) makes it clear that the military judge, when deciding preliminary questions relating to determining a military commission's jurisdiction, is not bound by the rules of evidence, except those with respect to privileges. Accord MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES, Mil. R. Evid. 104(a) [33]  Arguments of counsel in motion hearings or at trial are not evidence. Instead, counsel may only properly argue factual issues based upon previously admitted evidence at trial or an agreed upon stipulation of fact. [34]  The military judge ruled, \"A strict reading of the MCA would appear to require that, until such time as a CSRT (or other competent tribunal) makes a finding that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant, the provisions of the M.C.A. do not come into play and such person may not be charged, charges may not be referred to a military commission for trial, and the military commission has no jurisdiction to try him.\" Order on Jurisdiction of 04 Jun 2007 at 1, ¶ 7; see also Disposition of Prosecution Motion for Reconsideration of 29 Jun 2007 at 4, ¶ 4(d)(3)(a-b). [35]  See M.C.A. § 949a(a)(mandating that military commission procedures shall, to the extent practicable, \"apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence in trial by general courts-martial.\"); see also M.C.A. § 948b(c)(stating that the procedures for military commissions \"are based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under... the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\") [36]  M.C.A. § 948a(1)(A)(ii) appears simply to acknowledge the standards and definitions, enhanced procedural safeguards, and other general rights afforded a detainee through the C.S.R.T. process after passage of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. Of course, that Act was not in existence on the date Mr. Khadr's C.S.R.T. was conducted. Also, only C.S.R.T. (or other competent tribunal) determinations of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" status are considered dispositive of a military commission's personal jurisdiction over an accused detainee. No such determination has ever been rendered in this case. As mentioned earlier, the C.S.R.T. which considered Mr. Khadr's status classified him only as an \"enemy combatant.\" Having rendered no determination of Mr. Khadr's \"lawful\" or \"unlawful\" status, the C.S.R.T. finding of \"enemy combatant\" status is not entitled to enter Congress' statutory \"safe harbor.\" An \"enemy combatant\" finding is necessary for deciding whether to impose continuing detention upon an individual, but it is not dispositive for purposes of establishing military commission jurisdiction. [37]  See R.M.C. 202(b), Discussion (\"The M.C.A. does not require that an individual receive a status determination by a C.S.R.T. or other competent tribunal before the beginning of a military commission proceeding. If, however, the accused has not received such a determination, he may challenge the personal jurisdiction of the commission through a motion to dismiss.\"). [38]  See e.g., Article 45(2) of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. That Article suggests that a detained individual who is not being held as a POW has the right to assert an entitlement to POW status before a judicial tribunal, and that judicial adjudication of combatant status shall occur before trial for any alleged substantive offense. Following the M.C.A. procedures, as we interpret them here, would allow an accused to assert a claim of POW (i.e., lawful combatant) status at a pretrial motion session before the military judge. This pretrial determination of status would be fully in accord with Article 45(2) of Protocol I.\n",

significance of mr khadrs  csrt classification as an enemy combatant the subsequent referral of criminal charges against him to a military commission and the military judges sua sponte dismissal of those charges without prejudice  appellants appeal requires us to address two important issues first whether the military judge erred in ruling that mr khadrs september  csrt classification as an enemy combatant was insufficient to satisfy the congressionally mandated requirement established in the mca that military commission jurisdiction shall exist solely over offenses committed by alien unlawful enemy combatants see mca §§ c and da second if we answer the first question negatively we must determine whether the military judge erred in ruling that neither the military commission nor the military judge were empowered under the mca to receive evidence and thereafter assess mr khadrs status as an alien unlawful enemy combatant for purposes  of determining the commissions criminal jurisdiction over him  section d of the mca defines the jurisdictional limits of military commissions stating italics added the military judge in this case dismissed all charges and specifications without prejudice against mr khadr based upon his conclusion that the jurisdictional provisions of mca § d had not been met the judge correctly noted that the mca appeared to be clear in limiting jurisdiction for trial by military commission solely to unlawful enemy combatants and excluding from a commissions jurisdiction any lawful enemy combatants who instead must be tried under the provisions of the uniform code of military justice  usc §§  et seq we agree with the military judge that mr  khadrs  csrt classification as an enemy combatant failed to meet the mcas jurisdictional requirements in that it did not establish that mr khadr was in fact an unlawful enemy combatant to satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite for trial by military commission under mca § c only an alien unlawful enemy combatant is subject to trial by military commission the mca in § aa defines unlawful enemy combatant as follows appellant contends mr khadrs designation as an enemy combatant by his csrt in  was itself sufficient to establish the military commissions jurisdiction and that the military judge erred in ruling otherwise in its motion asking the military judge to reconsider his dismissal action appellant argued that the judge failed to give proper consideration and deference to a white house memorandum signed by president bush in february  which in appellants view declared all members of the taliban and al qaeda to be unlawful combatants under the geneva conventions see prosecution motion for reconsideration of june   at ; see also brief on behalf of appellant at  ¶ c appellant makes a similar argument regarding a july  memorandum from the deputy secretary of defense then mr paul wolfowitz to the secretary of the navy establishing the procedures to be employed for csrts and summarily declaring according to appellant congress enacted the mca fully aware of the  white house memorandum and the  wolfowitz memorandum including the definitional provisions and declarations contained in both appellant argues that it was the clear intent of congress to adopt the memorandas categorical declarations of combatant status regarding members of the taliban and al qaeda and that csrt determinations of enemy combatant status made prior to the adoption of the mca are sufficient to establish military commission jurisdiction see brief on behalf of appellant at  to  buttress these assertions appellant has directed us to rmc b which discusses in personam military commission jurisdiction and declares a finding whether before on or after the date of the enactment of the military commissions act of  by a csrt or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the president or the secretary of defense that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant is dispositive for purposes of jurisdiction for trial by a military commission under the mca appellant also highlights the following statement contained in the nonbinding discussion to rmc  regarding csrt determinations from the presidents  white house memorandum the  wolfowitz memorandum and this nonbinding discussion to rmc  we are now asked to categorically equate the administrations prior pronouncements regarding members of the taliban and al qaeda and use of the term enemy combatant throughout the csrt process with unlawful enemy combatant as defined in the mca and attribute that extrapolation to the clear intent of congress in this regard appellant invites us to interpret the parenthetical language contained in mca § aaiincluding a person who is part of the taliban al qaeda or associated forcesas evidence that congress statutorily ratified the presidents prior determination and that this crucial parenthetical established as a matter of statute that a member of al qaeda or the talibanwithout moreis an `unlawful enemy combatant who can be tried by military commission supplemental brief on behalf of appellant at  in light of the plain language of the mca and applying common logic and reasoning we decline to accept the appellants position we believe the congress well aware of the fact that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure see hamdan  us at   sct at   ledd at  citing ex parte quirin  us    sct   led   was abundantly clear in precisely establishing the jurisdictional prerequisites it intended to mandate prior to any criminal proceeding before such a commission could occur as with all matters of statutory interpretation we look first and foremost to the language contained in the statute itself see duncan v walker  us    sct   ledd  ; williams v taylor  us    sct   ledd   in doing so we give the words contained in the text their ordinary meaning and interpret the statute in a manner that does not render words or phrases superfluous unless no other reasonable interpretation can be made it is unequivocally clear to us from the plain language  of the mca that congress intended trials by military commission to be utilized solely and exclusively to try only alien unlawful enemy combatants the mcas jurisdictional provisions §§ c and d and definitions section § aai make this intent perfectly clear so also does the mcas express admonition in § db that military commissions shall not have jurisdiction to try a lawful enemy combatant congress further stated that a csrts or other competent tribunals determination that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant would be dispositive for purposes of establishing jurisdiction for trial by military commission see mca § dc no such statement is made regarding a prior designation of a detainee as simply an enemy combatant and in our opinion such designation is not useful in resolving this ultimate issue of criminal jurisdiction under the mca congress was undoubtedly aware of the white house  and wolfowitz  memoranda when they wrote and enacted the mca in  this is yet another case where congress in the proper exercise of its powers as an independent branch of government and as part of a long tradition of legislative involvement in matters of military justice has considered the subject of military tribunals and set limits on the presidents authority where a statute provides the conditions for the exercise of governmental power its requirements are the result of a deliberative and reflective process engaging both of the political branches hamdan  us at   sct at   ledd at  kennedy j concurring had congress intended prior designations of detainees as mere enemy combatants to be sufficient to establish military commission jurisdiction it was fully capable of saying this in the legislation it did not indeed neither the white house nor wolfowitz memoranda are ever referenced in the mca in our opinion congress clearly aware of the previously troubled military commission processand armed with affirmative guidance from the supreme court provided in the june  decision in hamdan v rumsfeldsought to enact new clear and unequivocal legislation to unambiguously guide and successfully implement trials by military commissions  we find no support for appellants claim that congress through the mca created a comprehensive system which sought to embrace and adopt all prior csrt determinations that resulted in enemy combatant status assignments and summarily turn those designations into findings that persons so labeled could also properly be considered unlawful enemy combatants similarly we find no support for appellants position regarding the parenthetical language contained in § aai of the mcaincluding a person who is part of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces we do not read this language as declaring that a member of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces is per se an unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction before a military commission we read the parenthetical comment as simply elaborating upon the sentence immediately preceding it that is that a member of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents will also qualify as an unlawful enemy combatant under the mca emphasis added this interpretation is consistent with § b of the mca which describes the general purpose of military commissions as existing to try alien unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the united states for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission italics added critical to this analysis is the understanding that unlike the white house and wolfowitz memoranda both of which declared enemy combatant status solely for purposes of continued detention of personnel captured during hostilities and applicability of the geneva conventionscongress in the mca was carefully and deliberately defining status for the express purpose of specifying the in personam criminal jurisdiction of military commission trials in defining what was clearly intended to be limited jurisdiction congress also prescribed serious criminal sanctions for those members of this select group who were ultimately convicted by military commissions contrary to the claims in appellants briefs the  white house memorandum never affirmatively declared members of al qaeda to be unlawful enemy combatants in the memorandum the president simply stated i also accept the legal conclusion of the department of justice and determine that none of the provisions of geneva apply to our conflict with al qaeda in afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world because among other reasons al qaeda is not a high contracting party to  geneva white house memorandum at  ¶ a the memorandum later states that because geneva does not apply to our conflict with al qaeda al qaeda detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war id at  ¶ d it is reasonable to assume that congress would seek to affirmatively declare the circumstances under which individual members of al qaeda could become unlawful enemy combatants for purposes of exacting criminal liability under the mca limiting criminal responsibility solely to an individual including a member of al qaeda or the taliban or associated forces who actually engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents appears to be the clear intent of congress and requires more than mere membership in an organization for criminal responsibility to attach regarding the taliban the  white house memorandum pronounced the provisions of geneva will apply to our present conflict with the taliban id at ¶ b however it then declared that the taliban detainees are unlawful combatants and therefore do not qualify as prisoners of war under article  of geneva id at ¶ d this decision was based upon the talibans failure to comply with fundamental law of war requirements again congress clearly aware of this language appears to have decided that only a taliban member who actually engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents should be subject to trial by military commission to accept appellants interpretation would allow criminal jurisdiction at a military commission to attach to members of the taliban or al qaeda who had never engaged in or supported hostilities finally the  white house memorandum concluded that common article  of the geneva conventions does not apply to either al qaeda or taliban detainees id at ¶ c the supreme court subsequently determined that legal conclusion was erroneous see hamdan  us at   sct at   ledd at  congress clearly aware of the hamdan decision when it drafted the  mca appears to have embraced the minimal safeguards guaranteed by common article  requiring that even unlawful enemy combatants be tried by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples see § bf mca quoting common article a military commission established under this chapter is a regularly constituted court affording all the necessary `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples for purposes of common article  of the geneva conventions; see also art iii gpw iii ¶ d no serious legal authority would contest the notion that one of the most indispensable and important judicial guarantees among civilized nations honoring a tradition of due process and fundamental fairness is the right to adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in regard to allegations which might result in criminal sanctions the mca did not exist until october  mr khadr could not have known at the time of his csrt in  that a determination of enemy combatant status pursuant to declarations contained in the  white house memorandum or definitions contained in the  wolfowitz memorandum could dispositively qualify him two years after the fact for potential criminal liability before a military commission as an unlawful enemy combatant we need not speculate how mr khadrs personal participation in his  csrt evaluation may have been impacted had he been on notice of the potential criminal liability the csrts findings could impose upon him such lack of notice offends our most basic and fundamental notions of due process; therefore it also violates common article  the declared purpose of the csrt process used to review the status of hundreds of foreign national detainees captured in iraq and afghanistan and currently held under defense department control at guantanamo bay naval base cubaincluding mr khadrwas solely to afford detainees the opportunity to contest designation as an enemy combatant wolfowitz memorandum at  the wolfowitz memorandum never discusses addressing the issue of lawful or unlawful enemy combatant status; nor does the memorandum from the secretary of the navy implementing the csrt process as far as we can discern the csrts were never tasked with making that determination instead they conducted nonadversarial proceedings aimed at deciding by a preponderance of the evidence whether each detainee met the criteria for designation as an enemy combatant under the definition in the wolfowitz memorandum to permit continued detention at guantanamo bay id at  in doing so mr khadrs  csrt employed a less exacting standard than that contained in the mca for establishing unlawful enemy combatant status a detainee could be classified as an enemy combatant under the csrt definition simply by being a part of the taliban or al qaeda without ever having engaged in or supported hostilities against the united states or its coalition partners id while such a classification would certainly be appropriate for authorizing continued detention during ongoing hostilities it does not address in any way the lawful or unlawful nature of the detained combatants belligerency under the mca congress never stated that mere membership in or affiliation with the taliban al qaeda or associated forces was a sufficient basis for declaring someone to be an unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction over that person in the mca military commission jurisdiction is limited solely to those who actually engaged in hostilities or who  purposefully and materially supported hostilities see § aaiemphasis added while mr khadrs csrt may have had more than sufficient evidence before it to properly classify him as an alien unlawful enemy combatant it was not charged with making that determination and could not have applied the definition established by congress as it did not come into existence until october two years later we will apply the clear and unambiguous jurisdictional language congress provided in the mca doing so we affirm the military judges conclusion that mr khadrs csrt classification in  as an enemy combatant was insufficient to establish the military commissions criminal jurisdiction over him  we next examine the military judges determination that the military commission is not the proper authority under the provisions of the mca to determine that mr khadr is an unlawful enemy combatant in order to establish initial jurisdiction for this commission to try mr khadr see military judges order on jurisdiction of june   at ; record at  a brief chronology of the procedural evolution of this military commission illuminates the judges ultimate ruling   after ruling that mr khadrs csrt classification as an enemy combatant was insufficient to establish the military commissions jurisdiction over him the military judge went on to conclude that he was not empowered to independently decide the matter of in personam jurisdiction because the mca requires that determination be made in advance for there to be jurisdiction to refer charges against the accused this is what congress directed and the military judge lacks authority to ignore this mandate disposition of prosecution motion for reconsideration ae  at  ¶ a after affirmatively concluding that neither he nor the military commission was authorized to render a determination on mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status and that such a determination had to be made as a prerequisite to referral the military judge faulted appellant for not presenting proof at the military commission hearing of mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status or requesting a continuance to more thoroughly brief the issue id at ¶¶ a & b in his ruling he also categorically rejected the implication that the prosecution was not allowed to present argument or evidence on jurisdiction id at ¶ b he then decided that the military commission did not have jurisdiction id at ¶ a we hold the military judge erred in two respects first in not affording appellant the opportunity to present evidence in support of its position on the jurisdictional issue before the military commission; and second in concluding that a csrt or another competent tribunal determination of unlawful enemy combatant status was a prerequisite to referral of charges to a military commission and that the military commission lacked the power to independently consider and decide this important jurisdictional matter under the mca  we review a military judges decision in regard to admitting or excluding evidence utilizing an abuse of discretion standard united states v billings   mj   caaf; see also general electric co v joiner  us    sct   ledd   the abuse of discretion standard of review recognizes that a judge has a range of choices in such matters and will not be reversed so long as the decision remains within that range united states v gore  mj   caafciting united states v wallace  fd   n  dccir ; united states v mccollum  mj   caaf applying this standard is also appropriate in reviewing a judges decisions regarding evidence production during a motion hearing or at trial both the record of trial and the military judges actions and rulings in this case demonstrate that the prosecution was not afforded the opportunity to present evidence to establish the military commissions in personam jurisdiction over mr khadr although the assistant prosecutor argued the military commission should interpret mr khadrs  csrt enemy combatant classification as satisfying the mcas jurisdictional language he also articulated a clear alternative position on the record see record at  record at  the assistant prosecutor then specifically listed the evidence the government would present in support of mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status which inter alia included a videotape of mr khadr engaged in unlawful combat activities including wearing civilian attire and making and planting roadside bombs admissions made by mr khadr and other statements that implicated him in conducting such unlawful activities record at  the military judge did not allow the government to present their evidence and instead inquired whether anyone thought about going back and doing new combatant status review tribunals record at  then after a very brief recess the military judge immediately announced his ruling on his own sua sponte motion and dismissed the charges without prejudice record at  we disagree with the military judges statement in his ruling on the motion for reconsideration that the prosecution did not make a formal offer of proof concerning any of the evidence which it now proposes be used disposition of prosecution motion for reconsideration ae  at  ¶ b the record demonstrates appellant offered and was ready to present evidence to affirmatively establish the military commissions jurisdiction over mr khadr but was summarily denied that opportunity the record does not support the assertion that the military judge afforded the prosecution an opportunity to present evidence on the jurisdiction and that they failed to do so asking counsel whether they have anything else to say  in oral argument upon a pending motion is not the equivalent of an invitation or offer to present evidence id at ¶ b; see eg record at  indeed oral argument upon a motion should rarely take place at all prior to evidence regarding the factual matters in dispute first being adduced at the motion hearing finally if there was any genuine confusion on this matter at the initial session of mr khadrs military commission appellants subsequent motion for reconsideration made it clear the prosecution was and remains fully prepared to present evidence that would clearly establish jurisdiction over the accused prosecution motion for reconsideration of june   at  for these reasons and those addressed in the next section of this opinion we find the military judge abused his discretion in deciding this critical jurisdictional matter without first fully considering both the admissibility and merits of evidence appellant offered to present on this issue  we also conclude that the military judge erred in ruling he lacked authority under the mca to determine whether mr khadr is an unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of establishing the military commissions initial jurisdiction to try him see military judges order on jurisdiction of june   at ; record at  the unambiguous language of the mca in conjunction with a clear and compelling line of federal precedent on the issue of establishing jurisdiction in federal courts convince us the military judge possessed the independent authority to decide this critical jurisdictional prerequisite a federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction united states v ruiz  us    sct   ledd   a military commission is no different see rmc ba military commission always has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction the military judge expressly acknowledged in his ruling upon the motion for reconsideration there is no express statutory directive that the government must establish jurisdiction before it is allowed to proceed with a military commission see disposition of prosecution motion for reconsideration at  ¶ e nevertheless the military judge concluded there were clear and unambiguous indicia that congress intended  initial jurisdiction be established before the mechanism set up by the mca was used in the case of a given person id he concluded the only avenue for establishing initial jurisdiction was through a prior determination of unlawful enemy combatant status by a csrt or other competent tribunal id at  ¶ ec while we agree with the military judges view that congress contemplated an initial assessment of an accuseds unlawful enemy combatant status prior to referral of charges to a military commission we disagree with his conclusion that the only avenue for the assessment is that delineated in mca § aaii see mca § ad as previously noted any alien unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents is subject to trial by military commission for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission see mca § ad; rmc b this jurisdiction attaches upon the formal swearing of charges against an accused after an individual subject to the  uniform code of military justice avers under formal oath that the charges are true in fact see rmc c and b charges may then be referred for trial by military commission under rmc  as long as reasonable grounds exist to believe that an offense triable by a military commission has been committed and that the accused committed it rmc d the only relevant limitation upon referral of charges is the requirement in rmc b that inter alia prior to referral the charges must be referred to the convening authoritys legal officer for pretrial advice and that individual must state his/her conclusion as to whether a military commission would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offense see rmc b all of these steps occurred in this case and as previously stated each offense referred for trial against mr khadr clearly alleges the express jurisdictional language used in the mca that he is a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant ae  at  emphasis added we find that this facial compliance by the government with all the prereferral criteria contained in the rules for military commissions combined with an unambiguous allegation in the pleadings that mr khadr is a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant entitled the military commission to initially and properly exercise prima facie personal jurisdiction over the accused until such time as that jurisdiction was challenged by a motion to dismiss for lack thereof or proof of jurisdiction was lacking on the merits in our opinion the mca is clear and deliberate in its creation of a bifurcated methodology for establishing an accuseds unlawful enemy combatant status so as to permit that individuals trial before a military commission these two methods are laid out in mca § aa where an unlawful enemy combatant is defined as emphasis added the disjunctive or between subsections i and ii clearly sets forth alternative approaches for establishing military commission jurisdiction see in re espy  fd   dccir`canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings and a statute written in the disjunctive is generally construed as `setting out separate and distinct alternativesquoting reiter v sonotone corporation  us    sct   ledd   the military judge did not apply the disjunctive separation of these two provisions and erroneously interpreted the distinct provisions as if written in the conjunctive; that is as if joined by the word and rather than or such an  interpretation would render subsection i nothing more than a definition in aid of a csrt or other competent tribunal determination of combatant status under subsection ii and is contradictory to the statutes clear structure wording and overall intent upon challenge the first method by which the mca contemplates jurisdiction being established is by evidence being presented before the military judge factually establishing that an accused meets the definition of unlawful enemy combatant as contained in subsection i in personam criminal jurisdiction over a criminal accused is generally a question of law to be decided by the military judge and is usually resolved only after presentation of evidence supporting jurisdiction and entry of corresponding findings of fact see united states v melanson  mj   caafwhen an accused contests personal jurisdiction on appeal we review that question of law de novo accepting the military judges findings of historical facts unless they are clearly erroneous or unsupported in the record; united states v ernest  mj   cmatwentyfour findings of fact entered by the trial court in determining whether to grant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction; united states v cline  mj   afcmrreturning record to trial court to more fully develop and analyze factual matters serving as basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction; see also united states v anderson  fd   th cirdetermining personal jurisdiction in light of alleged violation of extradition treaty there is a long and welldeveloped tradition in us federal courts and specifically throughout military courtmartial jurisprudence of military judges deciding matters of personal jurisdiction see eg solorio  us at    sct  listing military cases where personal jurisdiction litigated; j horbaly courtmartial jurisdiction  unpublished dissertation yale law schoollisting numerous cases involving courtmartial litigation to determine jurisdiction; department of the army pamphlet  legal services trial procedure  dec   congress clearly aware of historical courtmartial practice and desiring that military commissions mirror this firmly rooted practice to the maximum extent practicable would not have deprived military commissions of the ability to independently decide personal jurisdiction absent an express statement of such intent no such statement is contained anywhere in the mca the military judges reliance on mca § aaii for the proposition that a military commission itself cannot determine personal jurisdiction is misplaced this provision supports appellants position rather than detracts from it although congress assigned a jurisdictional safe harbor for prior csrt or other competent tribunal determinations of unlawful enemy combatant status by statutorily deeming them dispositive of jurisdiction it did not in any way preclude appellant from proving jurisdiction before the military commission in the absence of such a determination indeed the existence of a statutorily recognized path to  achieve a dispositive determination of jurisdiction suggests that pretrial procedures and pleadings alleging jurisdiction should simply be viewed as nondispositive subsection ii does not eliminate traditional methods of proving jurisdiction before the commission itself we agree with appellants suggestion that congress through subsection ii merely carved out an exception to the military commissions authority to itself determine jurisdictional matters see supplemental brief on behalf of appellant at  as appellant notes subsection ii makes it clear that the military judge is not at liberty to revisit a csrts or other competent tribunals finding of unlawful enemy combatant status when there is such a finding see appellants supplemental brief in response to courts request at oral argument at  however nothing in the mca requires such a finding in order to establish military commission jurisdiction had they so intended congress could have clearly stated in the mca that the only way to establish military commission jurisdiction is through a prior csrt or other competent tribunal determination of unlawful enemy combatant status it did not accordingly we may properly findas clearly indicated in the language of mca §§ aa and bcthat congress intended for military commissions to apply the principles of law and the procedures for trial routinely utilized by general courtsmartial this would include the common procedures used before general courtsmartial permitting military judges to hear evidence and decide factual and legal matters concerning the courts own jurisdiction over the accused appearing before it this view is supported in the rules for military commissions which provide exactly such procedures rmc b allows an accused to raise a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and recognizes lack of jurisdiction as a nonwaivable ground for dismissal of charges at any stage of the proceedings rmc cb assigns the burden of persuasion to the prosecution on a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction; rmc c sets that burden on any factual issue necessary to resolve the motion as a preponderance of the evidence clearly these rules contemplate potential litigation of personal jurisdictional issues by the military commission and provide the procedures necessary to address such a challenge if the only avenue to achieve military commission jurisdiction was through a previously rendered csrt or  other competent tribunal determination of unlawful enemy combatant status all of these rules would be superfluous as dispositive jurisdiction would have attached before the fact the text structure and history of the mca demonstrate clearly that a military judge presiding over a military commission may determine both the factual issue of an accuseds unlawful enemy combatant status and the corresponding legal issue of the military commissions in personam jurisdiction a contrary interpretation would ignore the bifurcated structure of mca § a and the longstanding history of military judges in general courtsmartial finding jurisdictional facts by a preponderance of the evidence and resolving pretrial motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the mca identifies two potential jurisdictionestablishing methodologies based upon an allegation of unlawful enemy combatant status the first reflected in § aai involves the clear delineation of the jurisdictional standard to be applied by a military commission in determining its own jurisdiction the second contained in § aaii involves a nonjudicial related jurisdictional determination that is to be afforded dispositive deference by the military commission either method will allow the military commissions exercise of jurisdiction where unlawful enemy combatant status has been established by a preponderance of the evidence this interpretation is consistent with the requirements of both the mca and with international lawsee murray v schooner charming betsy  us  cranch    led  acts of congress will generally be construed in a manner so as not to violate international law as we presume that congress ordinarily seeks to comply with international law when legislating because we find the military judge had the power and authority under subsection i of § aa of the mca to hear evidence concerning and to ultimately decide mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status we need not address whether or not a military commission is another

mr khadrs status classified him only as an enemy combatant having rendered no determination of mr khadrs lawful or unlawful status the csrt finding of enemy combatant status is not entitled to enter congress statutory safe harbor an enemy combatant finding is necessary for deciding whether to impose continuing detention upon an individual but it is not dispositive for purposes of establishing military commission jurisdiction   see rmc b discussion the mca does not require that an individual receive a status determination by a csrt or other competent tribunal before the beginning of a military commission proceeding if however the accused has not received such a determination he may challenge the personal jurisdiction of the commission through a motion to dismiss   see eg article  of protocol i to the geneva conventions that article suggests that a detained individual who is not being held as a pow has the right to assert an entitlement to pow status before a judicial tribunal and that judicial adjudication of combatant status shall occur before trial for any alleged substantive offense following the mca procedures as we interpret them here would allow an accused to assert a claim of pow ie lawful combatant status at a pretrial motion session before the military judge this pretrial determination of status would be fully in accord with article  of protocol i\n",

            "OPINION [*814] POSNER, Circuit Judge. The defendant pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced under the federal sentencing guidelines (before the Supreme Court's Booker decision) to 188 months in prison, the bottom of the applicable guideline range but only eight months above the statutory minimum. [HN1] The Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. 924(e), imposes a 180-month minimum sentence on anyone [*815] who has at least three prior convictions of specified offenses. The judge found that the defendant's criminal record qualified under this provision, and [HN2] findings of prior convictions are not within the scope of Booker's rule. United States v. Booker, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621, 125 S. Ct. 738, 756 (2005); United States v. Ngo, 406 F.3d 839, 2005 WL 1023034, at *2-4 (7th Cir. 2005) [**2] . \n"

the ex post facto clause of the us constitution and the term material support was erroneously defined by the military commission judge third that he was convicted on the basis of political speech in violation of the first amendment of the us constitution fourth that the  mca is an unconstitutional bill of attainder fifth that the  mca violates the constitutions equal protection clause by making aliens but not citizens subject to trial by military commission sixth that a sentence of life imprisonment is inappropriately severe and disproportionate to the sentences of closelyrelated defendants we specified two issues  we have carefully considered the record the various pleadings and oral arguments of the parties we hold that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact  and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of appellant occurred  mca §§ aa and fd  appellant a selfdescribed officer in al qaeda joined that group with knowledge that al qaeda engaged in terrorism and did so in complete agreement with usama bin ladens declarations that all americans and anyone in the united states were legitimate targets of armed attack following completion of al qaedas militarylike training appellant met personally with bin laden discussed al qaedas view of itself as a government in exile for the muslim world engaged in jihad or holy war with the united states and pledged his personal fealty including his willingness to die for bin laden and al qaeda bin laden then assigned appellant to al qaedas media office and later as his personal assistant/secretary for public relations appellants conduct in those positions and membership in al qaeda provide the factual basis for his convictions of  providing material support and resources to al qaeda;  conspiring with bin laden and others to inter alia commit murder attack civilians and civilian objects commit terrorism and provide material support for terrorism; and  soliciting various persons to commit those same offenses a brief review of al qaedas history organization and goals is essential to put appellants conduct in context  in december  the former soviet union invaded afghanistan the soviets were soon opposed by the mujahideen selfproclaimed muslim holy warriors including native afghans and volunteers for the proclaimed jihad against the soviet union by  radical palestinian cleric dr abdullah azzam emerged as leader of the arab recruits azzam and his supporters schemed to use the conflict in afghanistan as a means to create a multinational muslim army to wipe out secular regimes across the middle east asia and north africa and to establish an islamic caliphate in april  azzam published a manifesto titled `alqaida meaning `the base or the solid foundation in which he advocated armed struggle millionaire saudi exile usama bin laden    provided    financing and logistical support to azzams organization and soon    became a dominant force among the arabs fighting in afghanistan on september   azzam bin laden and mujahideen convened the first meeting of al qaeda the leaders of al qaeda formed a shura advisory council and divided operations amongst various wings including a military committee a security committee a financial committee a religious legal committee a political committee and a media committee following withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan the varying mujahideen factions turned on each other and dr azzam died in  facing collapse of the armed struggle in afghanistan bin laden moved to sudan set up business enterprises and sponsored overseas terrorist activities  al qaedas leaders were angered by american troop presence in saudi arabia following the  persian gulf war and believed that islamic doctrine prohibits the presence of infidels or nonmuslims in the `land of the two holy places  the arabian peninsula home to the sacred muslim cities of mecca and medina in december  following a fatwa religious edict issued on behalf of al qaeda condemning the presence of us military peacekeepers militants attempted to attack us soldiers in yemen who were en route to somalia peacekeeping duties in  bin laden announced that the american army now they came to the horn of africa and we have to stop the head of the snake  the snake is america and we have to stop them we have to cut the head and stop them later that year somali militiamen some of whom were al qaedatrained shot down two us blackhawk helicopters over mogadishu and  us servicemen were killed in the ensuing battle in  the sudanese regime ordered bin laden and his associates out of sudan they relocated to afghanistan at the invitation of the taliban in august  bin laden published a declaration of war in which he wrote in february  bin laden and likeminded allies founded the world islamic front against jews and crusaders and signed a joint fatwa requiring all able muslims to kill americans\\x97whether civilian or military\\x97anywhere they can be found and to plunder their money on may   bin laden issued a second declaration entitled the nuclear bomb of islam in which he stated that it is the duty of the muslims to prepare as much force as possible to terrorize the enemies of god on august   us embassies in kenya and tanzania were suicidebombed by al qaeda operatives resulting in  deaths including  americans on august   the us responded by striking terrorist training camps and a suspected chemical weapons laboratory in october  the us government officially designated al qaeda a foreign terrorist organization making it unlawful for anyone in the united states to provide material support to al qaeda and froze al qaeda linked resources held by us financial institutions in january  al qaeda attempted an attack on the uss the sullivans near yemen; however the attack boat was overloaded and sank that boat was recovered and on october   disguised as a friendly civilian boat welcoming the uss cole to port suicidedetonated against the cole killing  american sailors wounding  others and extensively damaging the ship on september    men recruited by al qaeda hijacked four commercial  airliners in the united states and intentionally crashed one airliner into the pentagon in washington dc and two into the world trade center in new york the fourth aircraft crashed in pennsylvania after the passengers attempted to retake the plane from the hijackers thousands of americans and others were killed as a result of the september   attacks  born in yemen on september   appellant is welleducated and speaks some english in the early s he was inspired by azzams speeches and traveled to afghanistan to fight the sovietsupported regime he then returned to yemen in the late s appellant approached a known al qaeda member in yemen about returning to afghanistan he used money and a visa provided by al qaeda operatives and traveled to afghanistan after completing militarylike training appellant talked to and pledged bayat to bin laden and joined al qaeda bin laden then assigned him to al qaedas media office following the october  attack on the uss cole bin laden instructed appellant to prepare a video exploiting that attack for recruiting purposes this fulllength video entitled the destruction of the american destroyer cole is comprised of extensive footage intended to inflame the viewers and incite them to migrate to afghanistan to train for and actively participate in violent jihad against the united states appellant was proud of the video claiming it was al qaedas best propaganda video at that time and that it was influential and produced a good result for al qaeda tr  translated into multiple languages and widely distributed outside afghanistan the video demonstrated power to incite persons with no prior connection to al qaeda to action the video is organized into three parts the problem the causes and the solution the problem is appellants portrayal of the muslim nation or ummah and includes emotive footage of purported muslims particularly women and children being mistreated and killed it also depicts the presence of us diplomats and troops in the middle east as part of the problem the video identifies the causes as diplomatic relationships between the united states and regional leaders and an alliance between the united states and israel the solution includes incensing images of violence against women and children interspersed with images of world leaders including american presidents laughing the horrific and infuriating images are shown repeatedly with religious chanting and a cappella singing known as anasheed audible in the background to increase the emotional impact of the video the anasheed extol the virtues of martyrdom suicide bombings of sacrifice and of combat somberly chanting lyrics such as revolt revolt  with blood with blood tr  the anasheed instructs the listener to trade blood for blood and destruction for destruction while showing images of violence against women and children dying then images of recruits training in al qaeda camps and terrorist attacks on americans and finally joyful muslims celebrating in the streets after highly emotional scenes of muslims suffering attributed to western infidels and complicit middle eastern regimes the video asserts violent jihad as the solution it calls on viewers to come to afghanistan to train for and actively participate in violent jihad against the united states during training camp scenes bin laden says the outcome of this training is jihad for the cause of god they are waiting  for our youths to annihilate america and israel prosecution ex  at  he continues the only way to eradicate the humiliation and disbelief that has overcome the land of islam is jihad bullets and martyrdom operations id at  toward the end of the video bin laden declares we are terrorists and terror is an obligation in the book of god let the west and east know that we are terrorists and we strike fear id at  appellant explained the importance he and bin laden ascribed to appellants role as a media man in supporting al qaedas objectives tr  after work on the video was completed bin laden appointed appellant as his personal assistant and secretary for public relations appellant assisted bin laden in preparing public statements he operated and maintained data processing equipment arranged for mohammad atta and ziad al jarrah two / hijackers/pilots to pledge fealty to bin laden and prepared propaganda declarations styled as martyr wills to motivate those individuals to commit the / attacks and document al qaedas role in those attacks before the / attacks bin laden ordered al qaedas kandahar site evacuated and told appellant to ready the media van which included computer satellite television and radio communications equipment appellant evacuated kandahar and traveled in a vehicle convoy which included bin laden and other al qaeda leaders on / appellant was unable to obtain a video signal so bin laden and other al qaeda leaders first heard reports of the / attacks via a radio operated by appellant at bin ladens request appellant researched the economic impact of the / attacks and provided the results of his research to bin laden following his capture appellant voluntarily spoke with multiple investigators regarding his background and role in al qaeda including his membership status as an officer role in production of the cole video and belief in bin ladens  declaration of war appellant advised investigators that he was willing to discuss his own actions but unwilling to discuss those of others prosecution ex  at  he admitted committing each charged act he also wrote several letters while detained at guantanamo bay to al qaeda leaders renewing his pledge of bayat restating his resolve to fight to the end and reaffirming his belief that war is the only way to secure al qaedas objectives prosecution ex  in prosecution ex  he stated  appellant objected to the legitimacy of the military commission that tried him and indicated his intent to boycott the proceedings he also objected to representation by counsel detailed by the chief defense counsel of military commissions he expressed a desire to proceed pro se and represent himself appellant also expressed his aspiration to absent himself from all sessions of the military commission except he wanted to attend the final session to hear announcement of his sentence the military commission judge advised appellant that his voluntary absence would constitute waiver of the right to be present that his absence could negatively impact the presentation of his case and that his absence would be inconsistent with representing himself and would provide a basis to terminate his proceeding pro se appellant conveyed his understanding stating this is my final decision and its voluntary y and ive chosen that tr  following this colloquy appellant absented himself from the next session of court on august   the military commission judge then noted appellants voluntary absence particularly with respect to the pro se issue major frakt appellants detailed defense counsel represented to the military commission judge that he discussed his willingness to defend appellant in the manner in which appellant desired to be defended tr  major frakt also confirmed he had discussed the pro se representation issue with appellant that appellant understood the impact of his voluntary absence from proceedings on his request to proceed pro se and then major frakt related that appellant expressed his very strong desire to return to the detention facility and to have no further communication with counsel of any kind tr  in light of appellants stated boycott and voluntary absence the military commission judge ruled that detailed defense counsel major frakt would continue to represent appellant appellants defense counsel then commented in accordance with mr al bahluls wishes defense demands under rule for military commission  a speedy trial the defense waives all pretrial motions of any kind and is prepared to go to trial at the soonest possible date tr  appellants posturing equivocation about his exercise of the right to counsel and proceeding pro se and variable attendance have combined to create a significant ambiguity in the record detailed defense counsel whose services were ostensibly rejected by appellant at the preceding session of court appeared on august   without appellant present putatively representing appellants wishes this ambiguity informs our treatment of the matters of waiver and forfeiture discussed in part xiv infra at pp  appellant attended the next session of court on september   and expressed his preference to attend the trial if such attendance would not forfeit his boycott the military commission judge informed appellant that his attendance would not forfeit his stated boycott and appellant attended all subsequent proceedings appellant entered pleas of not guilty to all charges and specifications with the exception of administrative matters and appellants unsworn statement and related documents presented during the presentencing hearing appellant presented no defense made no closing argument interposed no objection to prosecution evidence conducted no crossexamination of prosecution witnesses and presented no defense evidence in an unsworn statement to the members during the presentencing hearing appellant acknowledged his membership in al qaeda asserting we are the only ones on earth who will stand against you the  united states was responsible for the deaths of innocent civilians for  years and as such we give you the same cup you have given us tr  he declared that al qaeda does not submit to any arab government or to international law only to god he also commented that / was the consequence of us government policies and he expressed his willingness to die in prison and belief that al qaeda will prevail in its war against the united states he then cited a poem penned by bin laden named the storm of the airplanes tr  the members sentenced appellant to confinement for life  on appeal appellant challenges the authority of congress to legislate and the president or his designee to implement the  mca on a number of constitutional grounds he also alleges that the military commission judge misapplied the law and that the sentence awarded is inappropriately severe whether a military commission may exercise jurisdiction over the

commission id  appellee replies that the military commission validly exercised jurisdiction over the charged offenses brief for appellee ; brief on specified issues for appellant  specifically that the constitutional authority to define and punish offenses against the law of nations is vested in congress that the authority to determine the jurisdiction of military commissions belongs to the

limited to common law of war offenses appellant stands convicted of conduct which violates the common law of war id at  appellants challenge of congress constitutional authority to define his conduct as an offense raises fundamental and significant questions as to the scope of legislative and executive authority in this area and as to what if any deference is due the exercise of that authority by reviewing courts our review is guided by two fundamental principles first the canon of constitutional avoidance that being when the constitutionality of a statute is assailed if the statute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid it is our plain duty to adopt that construction which will save the statute from constitutional infirmity second we are also guided by the longstanding principle that an act of congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains murray v schooner charming betsy  us    cranch   led   the offenses of which appellant stands convicted were explicitly defined as such by congress in coordination with the president following the supreme courts decision in hamdan and explicitly intended to address punishment of those with whom the united states was and remains engaged in armed conflict in the words of justice jackson when national security relating to foreign affairs is an issue an action executed by the president pursuant to an act of congress would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude

international treaty law is generally characterized as rudimentary and customary international law is appropriately described as evolving the parties acknowledgement that  congress with the full support of the president developed a comprehensive code to define and punish the conduct of widely disparate individuals in a globalbattle space also informs our analysis even cursory review of the  mca reveals that congress cast a wide net of potential individual criminal liability with respect to the offenses which may be subject of trial by military commission of course we need not and jurisprudentially speaking indeed should not attempt to define the outer edges or margins of this plainly broad net unless required to do so by a specific issue in controversy in addition the hybrid nature of international terrorism presents unique legal and policy challenges as the underlying conduct is often punishable under the law of nations the domestic law of civilized nations or both consideration of the aforementioned particularly in this statutorily prescribed yet nascent military commissions system requires us to proceed with circumspection  accordingly we see the jurisdictional issue presented as similar to that addressed in ex parte quirin we are concerned only with the question whether it is within the constitutional power of the national government to place appellant on trial before a military commission for the offenses charged ex parte quirin   us    sct   led   more specifically we will focus on the charged conduct in each specification and inquire whether any of the acts charged is an offense against the law of war cognizable before a military tribunal and if so whether the constitution prohibits the trial id; see also ex parte milligan  us

stating in our military law the distinctive name of military commission has been adopted for the exclusively warcourt which  is essentially a distinct tribunal from the courtmartial of the articles of war  winthrop  he continued id emphasis in original in hamdan the supreme court agreed that military commissions have historically been used by the united states in three circumstances and that the situation relevant to the conflict with al qaeda is incident to the conduct of war when there is a need to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who  have violated the law of war   the  mca was developed and passed in direct response to the supreme courts decision in hamdan the stated purpose of the  mca is to establish  procedures governing the use of military commissions to try alien unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the united states for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission  usc § ba the  mca proclaims the provisions of this subchapter codify offenses that have traditionally been triable by military commissions this chapter does not establish new crimes that did not exist before its enactment but rather codifies those crimes for trial by military commission and acknowledges the effect of codifying preexisting offenses stating because the provisions of this subchapter are declarative of existing law  they do not preclude trial for crimes that occurred before the date of enactment of this chapter  mca § p the jurisdiction of military commissions convened under the  mca is limited to  alien unlawful enemy combatants auec and  any offense made punishable by this chapter or the law of war  mca § da the significance of these limits on the jurisdiction of a military commission convened under the  mca to our resolution of the assigned error is difficult to overstate these limits define both the type of person subject to trial by military commission convened under the  mca an auec and the offenses for which that person may be tried in a broad sense these two provisions define the personal or in personam jurisdiction and are fundamental to the definition of subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions convened under the  mca  the parties agree the constitutional authority to define and punish offences against the law of nations the define and punish clause provides congress a basis to establish a statutory framework such as the  mca for trying and punishing violations of the law of war us const art i §  cl  in addition the government asserts that when congress exercises its authority to define and punish violations of the law of war in conjunction with the executive and especially in the context of an armed conflict where national security is at stake its judgment is entitled to the greatest deference in response appellant avers that the supreme court has consistently required a plain and unambiguous showing that a war crime was established under the laws of war when the charged conduct occurred  judicial review of the scope of congressional authority to define and punish offenses against the law of nations is infrequent in an  decision the supreme court upheld a federal statute criminalizing the counterfeiting of foreign government securities explaining that the obligation of one nation to punish those who within its own jurisdiction counterfeit the money of another nation has long been recognized under the law of nations united states v arjona  us    sct   led   the court went on to reason that whether the offence as defined is an offence against the law of nations depends on the thing done not on any declaration to that effect by congress id at   sct  in arjona the supreme court did not address the scope of congress discretion or what if any deference courts should show a determination that a particular act constitutes an offense under the law of nations in  the supreme court addressed congressional authority in article i §  cl  to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas the same clause containing the separate congressional power to define and punish offenses against the law of nations united states v

that vessel killed another british subject id at  he was tried and convicted by a us court under a  law criminalizing piracy to include the offense of murder id at  the supreme court reasoned id at  we glean from furlong that the supreme court recognized the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is includes review of the congressional exercise of authority to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas marbury v madison  cranch   us    led  ; us const art i §  cl  the outer boundaries of congress discretion to define and punish  offences against the law of nations and to make such conduct punishable by military commissions remain an open question an  attorney general opinion suggests congressional authority to define such offenses is limited on the other hand there is substantial authority supporting the governments position  that greatest deference is due congress determination that the offenses of which appellant stands convicted constitute offenses under the law of nations; particularly where that determination directly implicates both national security interests in an ongoing armed conflict and foreign affairs including interpretation of treaty obligations and customary international law nonetheless we are not persuaded by the governments suggestion that congress power to define and punish  offences against the law of nations us const art i §  cl  even when exercised in collaboration with the president in a time of armed conflict includes the power to make conduct punishable by military commission

punishable by military commission  in making this determination we will employ the substantial showing standard discussed in the supreme courts hamdan decision aware that a standard more favorable to the government may as a matter of law be applicable where congress determination that certain acts constitute offenses under the law of nations is consistent with international norms we also conclude that the specific statutory scheme employed by congress to include the name of the offense the elements of that offense the forum by which that offense is punishable and the applicable rules/procedures is due great deference  when incorporating existing offenses against the law of nations into american jurisprudence it is well within congress grant of authority under the define and

civilian population is of fundamental import apii art  supra n  emphasis added suffice it to say there is no statute treaty or other international agreement which exhaustively details all offenses or conduct violative of the laws or customs of war however the fundamental guarantees of treaties applicable at any time and in any place whatsoever including conflicts not of an international character explicitly prohibit murder the intentional targeting of civilians acts of terrorism and acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population as specifically alleged or directly implicated here see discussion of common article  and apii at pp  supra n  these fundamental guarantees and prohibitions are central to determining whether appellant was lawfully tried and punished by military commission although common article  does not specifically adopt individual criminal liability for its violation  violations of common article  are considered domestically and internationally as crimes or war crimes the appeals chamber of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty an ad hoc tribunal established by the united nations in  to address varying atrocities that took place during the conflicts in the balkans in the s addressed this very issue in tadi&cacute; the appeals chamber found that certain norms of international armed conflict have evolved through customary law and now apply during noninternational armed conflict as well prosecutor v tadi&cacute; case no itar jurisdiction appeal ¶ ¶  oct   specifically tadi&cacute; itar at ¶  although we are not bound by the icty appeals chambers decision in tadi&cacute; the principles embodied in tadi&cacute; reveal that conduct during armed conflict that breaches fundamental principles or values may provide the basis for individual criminal liability for violation of the common law of war fundamental laws applicable in any armed conflict regardless of type and relevant here include  lawful combatants enjoy combatant immunity for precapture acts of warfare performed in the context of ongoing hostilities against lawful military targets to qualify as a lawful combatant an individual must satisfy the conditions specified in the  mca § a infra at n  and listed infra p   the law of armed conflict prohibits the intentional targeting of civilians and acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population  in stark contrast to these fundamental humanitarian principles and in direct contravention of the explicit prohibitions articulated in common article  and apii are the words posited by bin laden and the actions of al qaeda both before and after that edict in february  bin laden ostensibly speaking for the international islamic front for jihad against the jews and crusader announced a legal fatwa to our muslim nation prosecution ex  in that announcement he declared that prosecution ex  at  on may   bin laden was interviewed by abc news and reiterated that we do not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians they are all targets in this fatwah prosecution ex  at  on may   bin laden issued a declaration called the nuclear bomb of islam which included the statement it is the duty of muslims to prepare as much force as possible to terrorize the enemies of god with this foundational framework we turn to the statutory elements of the three offenses of which appellant stands convicted we will discuss the elements common to all three offenses and then discuss each offense individually  the term auec is fundamental to determining both persons subject to trial by military commission and the subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions convened under the  mca each specification states that appellant was an alien unlawful enemy combatant and alleges a direct nexus to al qaeda see charges infra pp    the statute as written and as applied at trial confirms the essential jurisdictional function of the auec determination the  mca explicitly limits jurisdiction over persons subject to trial by military commission to auecs and defines an auec as a person who  was not a citizen of the united states  was not a lawful combatant and  was an unlawful enemy combatant see supra n  quoting  mca § a at trial the military commission judge made a threshold determination that appellant was an unlawful enemy combatant for the limited purpose of establishing jurisdiction as that term is defined in the  mca § a tr   the military commission judges ruling by a preponderance of the evidence was consistent with his duty to  rule on interlocutory questions and all questions of law and practice in courtsmartial the military commission judge also required the fact finders to determine based upon legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt whether appellant was an alien unlawful enemy combatant and whether the alleged conduct occurred in the context of and was associated with an armed conflict tr  based upon the record before us making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses we agree with the military commission judge and the members that appellant was an auec as defined by the  mca and conclude that the military commission properly exercised jurisdiction over him we base this conclusion on our findings beyond any reasonable doubt that  appellant was a member of al qaeda during the charged time frame as evidenced by his admissions and other corroborating evidence;  appellant was a citizen of yemen and that he was neither a citizen nor resident of the united states; and  that appellant was not a lawful combatant as that term is defined in  mca § a see supra n  the specification of each charge explicitly stated that appellant was an auec and alleged a direct nexus to al qaeda the  mca defines unlawful enemy combatant as a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant including a person who is part of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces  mca § a supra n  this definition implicitly reflects that membership in al qaeda renders an individual an unlawful enemy combatant potentially punishable by military commission if that person is also an alien and not otherwise a lawful combatant this implication was made explicit in the  mca where an unprivileged enemy belligerent means an individual other than a privileged belligerent who\\x97c was a part of al qaeda at the time of the charged offense under this chapter  mca § ac see infra n  the military commission judge applied the  mca precisely in that manner he instructed the members that the auec determination was an element common to all the offenses and further instructed that the government must prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was an auec defining each key term in accordance with the statute accordingly appellants status as  an auec was crucial to the military commissions exercise of jurisdiction over appellant and determination of his guilt  under the law of armed conflict an auec is effectively synonymous with unprivileged enemy belligerent in other words a belligerent who is not entitled to combatant immunity or upon capture treatment as a prisoner of war it is based upon the statutory language and findings required by the military commission judge and members congress substitution of the phrase unprivileged enemy belligerent for unlawful enemy combatant in the  mca further supports this proposition as previously discussed unlawful combatants are  subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful quirin  us at   sct  the supreme court has long recognized that men and bodies of men who without being lawful belligerents nevertheless commit hostile acts of any kind are not entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war if captured and may be tried by military commission and punished by death or lesser punishment id at   sct  citing  rules of land warfare promulgated by the war department for the guidance of the army ¶ internal quotation marks omitted clearly both the plain language of the  mca see

assist in illegal hostilities stating in ¶  that persons culpable under ¶ ¶  and  who have attempted committed or conspired to commit hostile or belligerent acts are subject to the extreme penalty of death because of the danger inherent in their conduct lesser penalties may however be imposed  a former legal adviser us state department eloquently addressed the status of terrorists visàvis privileged or lawful belligerency in the following statement  the  mca definition of an auec is consistent with the meaning of an unprivileged belligerent under the common law of armed conflict see supra n  in the absence of any meaningful support for the proposition that appellant or other members of an armed group like al qaeda qualify as lawful or privileged belligerents under the law of armed conflict and upon consideration of the charged conduct and the entire record we also conclude beyond any reasonable doubt that appellant was an auec as defined in the  mca  the  mca as implemented in the  mmc requires a nexus between the charged conduct and an armed conflict  to be punishable this nexus performs an important narrowing function in determining which charged acts of terrorism constitute conduct punishable by such a law of war military commission while effectively excluding from their jurisdiction isolated and sporadic acts of violence not within the context of an armed conflict the  mmc includes this nexus as an element requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense occurred in the context of an armed conflict this element sometimes referred to as the contextual element or chapeaux is central to determining whether conduct is punishable by a law of war tribunal consistent with treaty law custom and practice the determination whether the hostilities in issue satisfy this element is objective in nature and generally relate to the intensity and duration of those hostilities in this case each specification states that all conduct occurred in various locations  in afghanistan pakistan and elsewhere appellant has not challenged the existence of an armed conflict between the united states and al qaeda either at trial or on appeal in hamdan the supreme court found an armed conflict to exist with al qaeda one governed by applicable conventional and customary laws of war hamdan  us at   sct  see supra n  there is no dispute that hostilities rising to the level of armed conflict existed in afghanistan pakistan and elsewhere including the united states no later than september   after consideration of the record in this case we conclude that hostilities rising to the level of armed conflict existed on or before february \\x97the beginning of the charged timeframe again the military commissions application of this contextual element proves illustrative the military commission judge instructed the members that tr  in conclusion the requirement that the charged conduct occur in the context of and associated with an armed conflict as defined in the mmc and by the military commission judge at trial are consistent with the law of armed conflict and the  mca this element is fundamental to the military commissions proper exercise of jurisdiction over any charged offense moreover after weighing all the evidence in the record and recognizing that we did not see or hear the witnesses we are also convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the united states was engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda during the charged timeframe in various locations in afghanistan pakistan and elsewhere  we begin our analysis by combining appellants three challenges to the charge of providing material support for terrorism   that providing material support for terrorism is not an offense punishable by military commission;  that this offense violated the ex post facto clause of the us constitution; and  that the military commission judge erroneously defined providing material support for terrorism at trial brief for appellant ; reply brief for appellant   appellant alleges that providing material support for terrorism is a novel domestic crime neither recognized nor charged as a war crime before passage of the  mca brief for appellant ; reply brief for appellant  he also argues that as an inchoate offense providing material support for terrorism was not punishable by military commission brief for appellant at ; reply brief for appellant  finally he avers that even assuming the offense was punishable by military commission the military commission judge erroneously defined that offense brief for appellant at ; reply brief for appellant  in hamdan we recently concluded that a military commission properly exercised jurisdiction under the  mca over the charged conduct in five specifications of providing material support for terrorism when committed by an auec in the context of an armed conflict with the requisite knowledge and intent see hamdan  fsuppd at   wl  at  citations omitted the conduct detailed in those five specifications was charged under two distinct formulations of the offense of providing material support for terrorism we disagree with appellants primary assertion that the charged conduct was not punishable by military commission when he committed the offenses see hamdan  fsuppd at    wl  at   citations omitted the charged conduct including appellants pledge of fealty to bin laden membership in al qaeda and intentional provision of material support or resources to al qaeda an international terrorist organization then engaged in armed conflict with the united states with knowledge that al qaeda had engaged in or engages in terrorism was punishable by military commission when committed  appellant was charged in the specification of charge iii with and convicted of the charged conduct shares some commonality with hamdans conviction for that same offense as both hamdan and al bahlul received militarytype training at an al qaedasponsored training camp both pledged fealty to bin laden both were al qaeda members and both provided personal services to bin laden in support of al qaedas goals and objectives however unlike hamdans more traditional soldierlike support eg armed physical security and transportation of persons and weapons appellant provided staffing and strategic support and was acquitted of providing physical security  the  mcas definition of providing material support for terrorism includes two principal formulations of conduct comprising that offense the first not alleged here includes providing material support    for or in carrying out an act of terrorism  mca § vba while the second charged here is that the accused intentionally provided material support or resources to an international organization engaged in hostilities against the united states id these two formulations are legally distinct accordingly our analysis and holding pertain only to the second  the  mmc in part iv ¶ bb lists the particular elements for providing material support for an international terrorist organization as follows  the statute defines material support or resources as any property tangible or intangible or any service this definition includes a nonexclusive list of property and services constituting material support or resources including expert advice or assistance  communications equipment  and personnel  or more individuals who may be or include oneself  by defining material support or resources as any property  or any service congress cast a wide net with respect to the scope of support and resources subject of the statute the supreme court acknowledged the broad scope of this definition in ruling on a recent challenge to the domestic law source of this definition of course the scope of the materialsupport statute may not be clear in every application holder v humanitarian law project  us ___  sct    ledd   in this case the specification of charge iii states appellant provided both material support and resources the primary resource charged was that he provided himself to al qaeda as a member; consistent with the statutes explicit recognition of personnel including oneself as material support or resources see  mca § vba quoted supra at nn  the specification states he traveled to afghanistan to join al qaeda met with an al qaeda leader underwent militarytype training at an al qaeda sponsored camp met with and pledged personal loyalty to bin laden and then joined al qaeda the specification of charge iii ¶¶ ad appellant was also charged with providing services in direct support of bin laden and al qaeda including preparation of  propaganda products intended for al qaeda recruiting and indoctrination training and inciting persons to commit terrorism; acting as personal and media secretary for bin laden facilitating the pledges of loyalty to bin laden and preparing the propaganda declarations styled as martyr wills for two suspected september   hijackers/pilots researching the economic effect of those attacks on the united states and providing the results to bin laden and operating and maintaining data processing equipment and media communications equipment for the benefit of bin laden and other al qaeda leaders the specification of charge iii ¶¶ ej although the services he provided are not explicitly identified in the statute the statutorily enumerated examples are a nonexhaustive list the charged services fall within the scope of the statutorily defined services to include expert advice or assistance after review of the record including the specification of charge iii and pleadings of the parties we conclude that appellants provision of himself as a member of al qaeda and his provision to al qaeda of various services constitute material support or resources as those terms are defined in the  mca  the offense of terrorism warrants particularized discussion as it is invoked in each charged offense the  mca § vb prohibits auecs from committing terrorism stating this definition of terrorism is incorporated into providing material support for terrorism see n  quoting  mca vba and may be appropriately characterized as the underlying offense in addition the specifications of the conspiracy and solicitation charges cite terrorism as an object offense accordingly we will discuss terrorism as that offense is defined in the  mca and international law the  mca definition is more comprehensive than common article  of the geneva conventions api and apii all prohibit the intentional targeting and killing of protected persons and acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population see supra n  in addition the  mca requires the government prove that the accused did so in a manner calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government or civilian population by intimidation or coercion or to retaliate against government conduct  mmc part iv ¶ b the  mcas inclusion of an additional element actually narrows the conduct subject to individual criminal liability and places an additional burden of proof on the government the  mca definition is also consistent with the most comprehensive definition of terrorism by international treaty extant on september   specifically the  financing terrorism convention included in its prohibition  of conduct meeting the definition of terrorism article  international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism dec    financing terrorism convention  unts   ilm  ga res / emphasis added the similarity in these definitions does not suggest that a universally accepted definition of terrorism existed at the time of appellants charged conduct or that such a definition currently exists in international law a more accurate description of the treaty law addressing international terrorism would be ad hoc longstanding efforts to define terrorism have been the subject of persistent political dispute primarily associated with national liberation movements concerns inapplicable to al qaedas attacks on the united states see alex schmid terrorism on trial terrorism\\x97the definitional problem  case w res j intl l   at least  antiterrorism treaties or conventions predate appellants offenses describing terrorism as a crime of international significance each of the treaties oblige the parties to criminalize various facets of terrorism in their domestic criminal codes and to cooperate in the prevention and punishment of acts of terrorism the organization of american states convention to prevent and punish the acts of terrorism taking the form of crimes against persons and related extortion that are of international significance  ust ; tias  feb   ratified by the united states oct

hundreds of innocent lives injured thousands of people and caused massive destruction to property sc res  un doc s/res/ aug   at ¶  in the same year the security council expressed its concern about the continuing use of afghan territory especially areas controlled by the taliban for the sheltering and training of terrorists and the planning of terrorist acts and reiterating that the suppression

actus reus appellants provision of himself as a member of al qaeda and various services as material support for al qaeda; common element \\x97alien unlawful enemy combatant element; see supra pp  common element \\x97that the conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an armed conflict and that the recipient of the support was an international terrorist organization engaged in hostilities against the united states see supra pp  as alleged the government was required to prove that al qaeda was then engaged in hostilities against the  united states thus further narrowing the scope of punishable conduct the subjective elements include both a mens rea or intent element and scienter or knowledge element specifically the  mca requires that the accused intentionally provides material support and resources to such an international terrorist organization with knowledge that such organization has engaged or engages in terrorism  mca § v review of the elements of providing material support for terrorism amply demonstrates that appellants charged conduct is not an inchoate offense instead the charged offense makes punishable the provision of material support or resources to an international terrorist organization engaged in hostilities against the united states with knowledge of that organizations past or ongoing terrorism and with specific intent to provide material support to that international terrorist organization this offense is akin to providing direct support to an ongoing criminal enterprise in this case one engaged in terrorism with knowledge of that enterprises past or ongoing crimes and with specific intent to support that criminal enterprise providing material support for terrorism is essentially coperpetrator liability analogous to membership in a criminal organization in that the essence is cooperation for criminal purposes and akin to aiding and abetting or complicity as such the theory of individual criminal liability has long been

funds and influence to its support id at  the tribunal reasoned that where clear crimes against humanity and war crimes were committed an organization which on a large scale is responsible for crimes such as mass murders can be nothing else than criminal one who knowingly by his influence and money contributes to the support thereof must under settled legal principles be deemed to be  certainly an accessory to such crimes id at  the tribunal noted that the monetary contributions commenced before the criminal activities of the ss were widely known that the prosecution did not prove that the money contributed was directly used for criminal activities that defendants played but a small part in the criminal program of the ss and that some of the money was likely used for cultural purposes id at   still the tribunal found that the criminal character of the ss must have been known and that how the money was spent was immaterial id  the tribunal found flick and steinbrinck  guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity by supporting the criminal organization responsible for such acts id at  with respect to steinbrinck the tribunal noted that he did not seek admission into the ss; his membership was honorary; he only had two official tasks neither of which were criminal in nature; he had no duties no pay and only casual connection with ss leaders; and that his

uses language which is akin to the criminal organization provisions of the nuremburg charter as implemented by the imt in fact the crime of conspiracy and criminal organizations were the subject of correspondence from the uniformed services senior military legal advisors and topics of discussion during congressional hearings congressional adoption of this relatively broad scope of  potential individual criminal liability with respect to international terrorism based at least in part upon membership in a criminal organization is a logical tack and evident in the plain language of the statute the  mca is consistent with the imts suggestion that future trials for criminal membership  include stiff due process guarantees to prevent injustice bush; supra n  at  citing  tmwc supra n  at  providing material support for terrorism includes stringent procedural safeguards and comprehensive factual determinations which must be satisfied before a conviction may be returned or punishment imposed the charged conduct readily meets the requirements of membership in a criminal organization appellant pledged fealty to bin laden and joined al qaeda an armed nonstate international terrorist organization engaged in armed conflict as a belligerent not entitled to either combatant immunity or pow protection from the time he joined al qaeda until his capture in  al qaeda was engaged in hostilities and terrorism against the united states appellant had knowledge that al qaeda engaged in terrorism before he joined and intentionally provided material support and resources to al qaeda from february  through december  that support included providing himself as a member of al qaeda and various services including propaganda products intended for al qaeda recruiting and indoctrination training; inciting others to commit terrorism; facilitating pledges of loyalty to bin laden and preparing the propaganda declarations styled as martyr wills of two suspected september   hijackers/pilots; operating and maintaining data processing equipment and media communications equipment used to obtain the first reports of the september  attacks to bin laden and other al qaeda leadership; and researching the economic effect of those attacks on the united states and providing the results of his research to bin laden similar to the imts declaration of groups and organizations as criminal organizations congress stated that an unlawful enemy combatant includes a member of al qaeda not otherwise a lawful combatant in the  mca however unlike the imts determination of organizational guilt which was binding upon the nmt the military commission judge made an initial determination that the military commission had personal jurisdiction specifically that the evidence established appellant is an auec tr   and ultimately this determination was made by the members as an element of each offense applying an evidentiary standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt tr   finally this proposition is also consistent with the longheld us view expressed through successive us army field manuals that unprivileged belligerents who engage in hostilities are subject to punishment under the law of armed conflict see supra pp  quoting  manual ¶¶   and ;  fm  ¶¶   and  the government has made a substantial showing see supra n  that appellants charged conduct including his membership in al qaeda an international terrorist organization and intentional provision of material support and resources to al qaeda with knowledge that al qaeda engaged in or engages in terrorism and was engaged in armed conflict with the united states constituted an offense  against the law of armed conflict punishable by military commission when committed  as articulated in our recent decision in hamdan the relatively recent yet widely accepted theory of individual criminal liability known as joint criminal enterprise jce provides additional support for the conclusion that the charged formulation of providing material support for terrorism was punishable by military commission when the offense occurred jce is rooted in the jurisprudence of nuremburg and other postworld war ii tribunals and is derivative of direct commission of an offense or a form of coperpetration jce has been adopted or recognized as a theory of individual criminal liability based upon ones participation in a criminal enterprise under customary international law in various treaties and international tribunal decisions since at least the s in  the un security council established the first of the modern international tribunals\\x97the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty\\x97as an ad hoc court to prosecute crimes committed during the period of armed conflict in

nonserb population id at ¶¶  he was therefore held to be responsible for the five deaths since they were perpetrated in the course of and were a foreseeable consequence of the common plan id at ¶¶  the jce doctrine which extends individual criminal liability to each member of an organized criminal group for crimes committed by the group within the common plan or purpose and requires an overt act in support of the offense shares many attributes of providing material support for terrorism for example following world war ii a british military court tried two german servicemen and five civilians for war crimes in the deaths of three british airmen who were attacked and killed by a mob while under the escort of a german soldier in the essen lynching case prior to the attack a german officer in a loud voice and in the presence of a crowd ordered that the escort should not interfere if german civilians should molest the prisoners adding that the prisoners ought to be shot or would be shot id although the officer was not present when the crowd attacked the british airmen he and the escort were convicted of murder even though they had not struck the airmen id in the milo&sacute;evi&cacute; case prosecutors argued that the indictments against milo&sacute;evi&cacute; were all part of a common scheme strategy or plan on the part of the accused to create a `greater serbia a centralized serbian state encompassing the serbpopulated areas of croatia and bosnia and all of kosovo and that this plan was to be achieved by forcibly removing nonserbs from large geographical areas through the

although the united states has not ratified the rome statute of the international criminal court icc as of june   there were  state parties and  states have signed the rome statute of the icc creating a standing tribunal with jurisdiction over individuals alleged to have committed genocide crimes against humanity war crimes and eventually crimes of aggression rome statute of the icc supra n  art  see also report of the icc to the un general assembly a// pp  aug   article  of the rome statute includes an expansive list of available theories of individual criminal liability including jce specifically article d provides that a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment in accordance with this statute if he thus the icc statute includes a jce theory of individual criminal liability based upon the knowing or purposeful contribution to the commission or attempted commission of such crimes by a group acting with a common purpose the incorporation of jce in other international conventions including the  convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings are reflective of the efficacy of jce under international law  in response to issues specified by this court appellant asserts that for jce to be relevant here the offenses charged would have to establish his coperpetration of a specific and completed war crime and that such completed elements were neither alleged nor found brief on specified issue for appellant  he further argues that the material support charge is not a completed offense that it does not require intent to further a foreign terrorist organizations illegal activities and that assuming the provisions of the  mca could be construed as requiring the equivalent of jce liability for the underlying crimes that appellant was not on notice that he was subject to personal liability as a principal for underlying war crimes id at  citations omitted we disagree appellant correctly asserts that for jce to be relevant the specification must allege a completed offense but contrary to his assertion that requirement is satisfied here for the reasons discussed supra we conclude that the specification describes at least two theories of culpability  membership in a criminal organization eg intentionally joining or membership in al qaeda an international organization that engages in terrorism with knowledge of that terrorism and  terrorism eg as a coperpetrator of that offense the charged offense of providing material support for terrorism shares attributes with all three types of jce but most closely resembles basic and extended jce the charged conduct includes that appellant intentionally provided himself as a member of al qaeda and various material support or resources to al qaeda with knowledge that al qaeda engaged in or engages in terrorism eg intentional attacks on protected persons with the intent to terrorize the civilian population and was then engaged in hostilities with the united states although the mens rea element of the charged offense is not identical to the mens rea requirements of either basic jce or extended jce it is substantially similar to the intent element of both types of jce see supra pp  and n  in fact the mens rea requirements of the charged offense of providing material support for terrorism may be more onerous than that present in either basic or extended jce in that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused with knowledge that al qaeda engaged in or engages in terrorism intentionally provided himself and other services which requires two separate mens rea findings first that he  intentionally provided himself and other enumerated services or resources to al qaeda; and second that he did so with knowledge that al qaeda engaged in or engages in terrorism which incorporates an additional mens rea requirement attributable to the perpetrators of that terrorism eg intentionally killing or infliction of great bodily harm on one or more protected persons or intentionally engages in an act  mca § vb supra p  again the military commission judges instructions reflect that the military commission applied the law in precisely this manner tr  at a minimum the extended jce mens rea requirement eg intent to participate in contribute to and further the criminal activity or criminal purpose of al qaeda see supra pp  is implied in the specification which provides examples of the hostilities al qaeda engaged in both before appellant joined and while he was a member of al qaeda indeed the most notorious charged conduct was that appellant prepared propaganda products including the video `the destruction of the american destroyer uss cole to solicit material support for al qaeda to recruit and indoctrinate personnel to the organization and objectives of al qaeda and to solicit incite and advise persons to commit terrorism a video titled to sensationalize one of the enumerated examples of al qaedas violent attacks on the united states the october  attack on the uss cole in aden yemen the specification of charge iii ¶ e supra p  even assuming arguendo that the providing material support for terrorism mens rea requirement is less arduous than that required in extended jce and as such reduces the governments burden while expanding the scope of conduct punishable we are convinced that congress did not exceed its constitutional authority to define and punish offenses against the law of nations in codifying this formulation of providing material support for terrorism the charged conduct of which the members ultimately returned findings of guilty was that appellant travelled to afghanistan with the purpose and intent of joining al qaeda met with a key al qaeda figure as a step to joining al qaeda underwent militarytype training at an al qaeda sponsored training camp pledged loyalty to al qaedas then leader bin laden and joined al qaeda with knowledge of its terroristic activities which continued throughout the entire period charged of february december  the government has made a substantial showing see supra n  that the jce theory of individual criminal liability provides additional support for the conclusion that the charged offense of providing material support for terrorism was punishable by military commission at the time committed  principle vii of the nuremberg tribunal report also recognized complicity in the commission of a war crime as an offense under international law the three essential elements of complicity are   the commission of a crime;  the accomplices\\x97one who is complicit\\x97material contribution to the commission of that crime; and  the accomplices intention that the crime be committed or the accomplices reckless disregard for the potential of its commission in the tadi&cacute; judgment supra n  ¶  the icty appeals chamber commented on the distinction between persons in organizations implicated in war crimes particularly organizational leaders who often are accomplices as opposed to the physical perpetrators of the acts as follows one scholar recently argued in the context of genocide that another scholar asserts that proof of complicity requires prosecutors to show intentional participation in acts that contributed toward a criminal result without defendants prior agreement toward that end bush supra n  at  the offense of complicity further supports the conclusion that appellants conduct violated the law of armed conflict at the time committed  the historical us practice of trying the offense of aiding the enemy by military commission provides additional support or at a minimum analogical support for the conclusion that appellants charged conduct as providing material support for terrorism was punishable by military commission  aiding the enemy has long existed in us military jurisprudence the continental congress enacted the american articles of war of  including section xiii article  which punishes any person who provides relief of the enemy with money victuals or ammunition or who knowingly harbors or protects an enemy winthrop supra n  at  congress subsequently enacted article of war  continuing the prohibition against aiding the enemy id at  winthrop concludes that civilians can be tried for aiding the enemy under this article id at  on august   congress included aiding the enemy as an offense in article of war  and subsequently in ucmj art  united states v olson  uscma   cmr   wl   discussing genesis of article of war  and article  ucmj; see mcm  mcm  mcm  enemy is

wl  at  n  quoting  mcm part iv ¶ cb the term enemy clearly includes members of al qaeda who have engaged in acts of terrorism id at § ai the elements of providing material support to terrorism are similar to the elements of article  ucmj as colonel winthrop noted winthrop supra n  at  emphasis added in  article of war  expanded the offense of aiding the enemy when or other thing was added to prohibit providing intangible aid to the enemy which could include appellants conduct see olson  uscma at   cmr  in conclusion the government has made a substantial showing see supra n  that the charged conduct including appellants pledge of fealty to bin laden and membership in al qaeda an international terrorist organization and intentional provision of material support and resources to al qaeda with knowledge that  al qaeda engaged in or engages in terrorism and was engaged in armed conflict with the united states constituted an offense under the law of armed conflict when committed congress did not exceed its constitutional authority by defining and making such conduct punishable by military commission as providing material support for terrorism appellant has simply proffered no persuasive argument under treaty or customary international law that membership in a terrorist organization such as al qaeda when engaged in armed conflict with a nation state entitles an individual member to any special status under the law of armed conflict to the contrary customary practice has been to treat such persons as outside the protections of the law of armed conflict punishable for their own criminal acts and if membership is established their membership in that criminal organization the domestic laws of many nations prohibiting conduct similar to providing material support for terrorism also strongly suggest that such prohibitions constitute general principles of law recognized by civilized nations the statutory scheme employed by congress in the  mca including the common elements auec and in the context of an armed conflict stringent procedural safeguards and comprehensive factual determinations are consistent with international norms congress did not exceed its constitutional authority in choosing a name for the offense\\x97providing material support for terrorism or in defining the elements of providing material support for terrorism  appellant had knowledge that al qaeda engaged in terrorism before he joined and intentionally provided himself and other material support and resources to al qaeda including various propaganda products intended for al qaeda recruiting and indoctrination training and inciting others to commit terrorism he was also convicted of facilitating the pledges of loyalty to bin laden and preparing the propaganda declarations styled as martyr wills of two suspected september   hijackers/pilots operating and maintaining data processing equipment and media communications equipment used to obtain the first reports of the september  attacks to bin laden and other al qaeda leadership in addition he was convicted of researching the economic effect of those attacks on the united states and providing the results of his research to bin laden and acting as media and personal secretary for bin laden in light of our decision in hamdan  fsuppd at    wl  at   and consistent with our discussion supra pp  appellants charged conduct has long been punishable as membership in a criminal organization and at a minimum each additional charged act relates directly to appellants knowledge intent or actions in support of al qaeda an international terrorist organization with no colorable claim of legitimacy under the law of armed conflict the similarity of the charged conduct and statutory requirements in the  mca of knowledge and intent to membership in criminal organizations the jce theories of individual criminal liability complicity and aiding the enemy reinforce our holding that appellants charged conduct violated the law of armed conflict when committed  appellant also asserts the military commission judge erroneously included propaganda and recruiting materials within the definition of material support in his instructions to the members  brief for appellant   ; reply brief for appellant  ; tr  the military commission judge used the same definition for all three charges tr    a military commission judge shall give the members appropriate instructions on findings  mmc part ii rmc a see united states v martinez  mj   cma citing united states v groce  mj   cma there was no objection to these instructions during trial by either party thus pursuant to rmc f the matter is waived absent plain error we have not previously addressed what constitutes plain error in the context of the  mca and note that neither the statute nor mmc defines plain error the statute does limit our authority to act with respect to matters of law in that a finding or sentence of a military commission under this chapter may not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused  mca §§ fd and aa this limitation is also present in the ucmj and closely resembles that applicable in article iii courts  usc § a and fed rcrimp b see supra p  the supreme court recently commented that federal rule of criminal procedure rule b permits an appellate court to recognize a `plain error that affects substantial rights even if the claim of error was `not brought to the district courts `attention united states v

  th cir  appellant provided a variety of resources and services including preparing  propaganda and recruiting materials to an international terrorist organization the statutory definition begins material support and resources means any property tangible or intangible or service including  usc § ab supra n  emphasis added clearly propaganda and recruiting materials are within the terms any property  and services the military commission judge was simply clarifying and amplifying the definition of material support and did not change the meaning of the defined term or expand appellants potential criminal liability his instructions assisted the members in determining whether appellant committed the charged conduct we note that the members determination of those facts was required to be by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt thus we find no error  appellant asserts that the offense of conspiracy is not recognized as a war crime under international law and thus is not punishable by military commission brief for appellant   he acknowledges us precedent for conspiracy prosecutions by military commission but notes that those military commissions exercised jurisdiction under martiallaw as well as the law of war reply brief for appellant  appellant emphasizes the precedent of the hamdan plurality opinion that the government failed to make even a `merely colorable case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by lawofwar military commission brief for appellant  citing hamdan  us at   sct ; reply brief on specified issues for appellant  the government argues that the constitutional authority to establish the jurisdiction of military commissions belongs to the political branches exercising their war powers the government asserts that terrorists are akin to guerrillas engaged in irregular war and that conspiracy has historically violated the law of war and been tried by military commission brief for appellee  ; see also  fm  supra pp  at ¶¶  in support of this argument the government cites the widespread acceptance of the jce theory of individual criminal liability international consensus on the illegality of conspiratorial type conduct and the longstanding us view that conspiracy is punishable under the law of war specified issues brief for appellee  these diametrically opposed assertions represent more than adversarial hyperbole the viability of conspiracy as a war crime has long been the subject of controversy some form of conspiracy has been included as a charge and often as part of a judgment in every major american war crimes trial program from the civil war cases to nuremberg and tokyo after world war ii this controversy  has persisted since the nuremburg tribunals with the views of highly qualified publicists ranging from the imts rulings were dispositive on the subject of international conspiracy and that the restrictive interpretation is therefore the rule in modern international law; bush; supra n  at  and n  citing antonio cassese international criminal law   to the counter observation that such a view omits the teachings of the complex underutilized tokyo judgment which assessed conspiracy far more permissively   as well as of the french war crimes trials that later were held under control council law no  bush emphasized in his thorough discussion of international conspiracy law the imt at nuremburg ruled that its own jurisdiction under the london charter extended only to conspiracy to commit crimes against peace and not conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity bush at  supra n  at n  citing the nurnberg trial  tmwc at  the charter does not define as a separate crime any conspiracy except the one to commit acts of aggressive war this controversy is also readily apparent in the supreme courts decision in hamdan resolution of this enduring and complex controversy is not  essential to decide appellants challenge consistent with the issue presented we will focus on whether any of the acts charged is an offense against the law of war cognizable before a military tribunal and if so whether the constitution prohibits the trial  appellant as an auec in the context of and associated with an armed conflict at various locations in afghanistan and elsewhere from in or about february  through in or about december  was convicted of conspiring with usama bin laden saif al `adl and other members and associates of al qaeda known and unknown to commit one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission to wit murder of protected persons; attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder in violation of the law of war; destruction of property in violation of the law of war; terrorism; and providing material support for terrorism and with knowledge of the unlawful purposes of the agreement    willfully entered the agreement with the intent to further those unlawful purposes and knowingly committed the following overt acts in order to accomplish some objective or purpose of the agreement the similarity between appellants conviction of conspiracy in the specification of charge i and providing material support  for terrorism in the specification of charge iii ¶¶ aj supra pp  including the same ten overt acts informs our analysis of the assigned error we next turn to the statutory definition  the  mca § vb defines conspiracy as the  mmc part iv ¶ b defines the elements of conspiracy as follows  the  mca defines conspiracy more narrowly than the ucmj title  of the uscode or common law in addition to the common elements  auec and in the context of an armed conflict the following distinctions are noteworthy first only agreements to commit   substantive offenses triable by military commission under  mca § vb are punishable as conspiracies consequently to be punishable as conspiracy under the mca the offenses object of the agreement must be punishable under the statute second the accused must knowingly commit  an overt act in order to accomplish some objective or purpose of the agreement or enterprise individual criminal liability is therefore limited to persons who have themselves  committed an overt act in order to accomplish some objective or purpose of the agreement or enterprise and  knowingly done so under the ucmj and the general conspiracy statute  usc §  individual criminal liability attaches if an overt act is committed by any party to the agreement finally conspiracy as defined in the  mca § vb and the  mmc clearly casts a wide net of potential individual criminal liability; however we are mindful that two congresses and two presidents have agreed that conspiracy to commit offenses enumerated in the  and  mca violate the law of armed conflict and are punishable by military commission each of the seven offenses alleged as objects of the conspiracy in the specification of charge i is defined as an offense punishable by military commission in the  mca see  mca §§ vb vb vb vb vb vb and vb the first five object offenses  murder of protected persons;  attacking civilians;  attacking civilian objects;  murder in violation of the law of war; and  destruction of property in violation of the law of war constitute noncontroversial longstanding violations of the law of armed conflict punishable by military commission the remaining  two object offenses  terrorism and  providing material support for terrorism are the subject of considerable discussion in this opinion see supra pp  congress did not exceed its constitutional authority by defining terrorism as an offense in the  mca and in making such conduct punishable by military commission when committed by an auec in the context of an armed conflict see supra pp ; see also hamdan  fsuppd at   wl  at  the  mca offense of terrorism is consistent with common article  and apii supra n  firmly established international norms and general principles of law recognized by civilized nations and was applicable at the time of the conduct alleged similarly congress acted within the scope of its constitutional authority by defining providing material support for terrorism as an offense in the  mca and in making the conduct alleged here and in hamdan punishable by military commission when committed by an auec in the context of an armed conflict see supra pp ; see also hamdan  fsuppd at  and nn   wl  at  and nn  in this case we focused on the specific circumstances of appellants pledge of fealty to bin laden his membership in al qaeda an international terrorist organization and his intentional provision of material support and resources with knowledge that al qaeda engaged in or engages in terrorism and was then engaged in armed conflict with the united states see supra pp  our conclusion was grounded in the customary practice of treating such persons as outside the protections of the law of armed conflict punishable for their own criminal acts and those of the armed group of which they were a member appellant was essentially charged with and convicted of conspiring and agreeing with bin laden and other al qaeda members to commit the seven object offenses and with knowledge of the unlawful purposes of that agreement willfully entering into that agreement with the intent to further those unlawful purposes he knowingly committed the enumerated overt acts in order to accomplish some objective or purpose of the agreement  including traveling to afghanistan with the intent of joining al qaeda undergoing militarytype training at an al qaeda camp meeting with and pledging personal loyalty to bin laden and then joining al qaeda the specification of charge i ¶¶ ad after joining al qaeda appellant committed numerous additional acts in order to accomplish some objective or purpose of the agreement including preparation of various propaganda products including the video `the destruction of the american destroyer uss cole to solicit material support for al qaeda to recruit and indoctrinate personnel to the organization and objectives of al qaeda and to solicit incite and advise persons to commit terrorism; acting as a personal secretary and media secretary for bin laden; facilitating the pledges of loyalty to bin laden and preparing the propaganda declarations styled as martyr wills for two suspected september   hijackers/pilots researching the economic effect of the acts of terrorism perpetrated on the united states by those two hijackers/pilots on september   and providing the results to bin laden and operating and maintaining data processing equipment and media communications equipment for the benefit of bin laden and other al qaeda leaders the specification of charge i ¶¶ dj this offense as codified and charged provided comprehensive notice of both the conduct in issue and the elements of the offense in fact the government was required to prove both objective and subjective elements the objective elements include an actus reus which is appellants agreement with bin laden and others to commit the offenses that are the object of the conspiracy and the charged overt acts included his pledge of fealty to bin laden and membership in al qaeda as well as the various support and services he personally provided al qaeda; his status as an auec; and that the conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an armed conflict the specification of charge i additionally the subjective elements include both a scienter or knowledge element and mens rea or intent element specifically that the accused knew the unlawful purpose of the agreement and joined willfully that is with the intent to further its unlawful purpose  mmc part iv ¶¶ b supra p  the military commission judges instructions to the members articulated these requirements and serve to illustrate the subjective elements of the offense likewise the act of uniting with banditti jayhawkers guerillas or any other unauthorized marauders has long violated the law of armed conflict and that offence is complete when the band is organized or joined  op atty gen at  see supra p  recent treaty law acknowledges participation in a transnational organized criminal group in a manner similar to the charged conspiracy as punishable conduct see convention against transnational organized crime art  quoted at p  and cited supra n  in addition punishment of such conduct under domestic criminal law reflects widespread agreement on this fundamental principle appellants charged conspiracy is directly akin to the criminal organization provisions of the nuremburg charter in articles  and  as implemented by the imt see discussion supra pp  we also find that appellants conduct readily meets  the requirements of membership in a criminal organization appellants conduct including his agreement with bin laden and others to commit the object offenses with knowledge of and intent to further the unlawful purposes of that agreement and commission of the enumerated overt acts including meeting with and pledging personal loyalty to bin laden and then joining al qaeda was punishable by military commission as an offense against the law of armed conflict when committed additionally and like the conduct charged as providing material support for terrorism see jce supra pp  and complicity supra pp  the offense of conspiracy as charged is essentially coperpetrator or principal liability akin to aiding and abetting or complicity theories of individual criminal liability long recognized under the law of armed conflict and in the domestic law of civilized nations this is particularly true where as here the accused voluntarily conspires and agrees with al qaedas leadership to commit at least seven separate offenses against the law of armed conflict and with knowledge of and intent to further the unlawful purposes of that agreement knowingly commits various overt acts to accomplish some objective of that agreement including pledging loyalty to bin laden joining al qaeda and providing various services and resources to both the mens rea element as defined in  mca § vb supra p  and the  mmc part iv ¶¶ b supra p  and as applied by the military judge at trial also duplicates that required for basic jce shared intent to perpetrate a certain crime and extended jce intent to participate in and further the criminal activity or the criminal purpose of a group see supra pp   the domestic laws of many nations address conspiracy and conspiracylike conduct and include similar language see supra n  for the

international terrorist organization and to solicit induce and advise said persons to commit murder of protected persons among other offenses that violate the law of war  since world war ii inchoate liability for crimes against peace and genocide have been recognized as offenses under international law this is appropriate given the seriousness and insidiousness of the object offenses the imt at

established custom prohibiting genocide or incitement to commit genocide however the imt concluded streichers incitement to murder and extermination at the time when jews in the east were being killed under the most horrible conditions clearly constitutes persecution on political and racial grounds in connection with war crimes as defined by the charter and constitutes a crime against humanity id at  the imt linked streichers propaganda with the war crimes that had been carried out    to establish a parallel to the specific intent requirement in criminal law he was  sentenced to death by hanging  tmwc supra n  at  the imt acquitted hans fritzsche a senior official in goebbels ministry of popular enlightenment and propaganda and host of a weekly radio show id at    the prosecution argued that fritzsche incited and encouraged the commission of war crimes by deliberately falsifying news to arouse in the german people those passions which led them to the commission of atrocities id at  however the imt reasoned id at  the judgment suggests that the imts reasons for acquitting fritzsche lay in the fact that first he lacked the necessary intent or such intent had not been proved

awareness of the threat terrorism presents to both domestic stability and international peace and security much like julius streicher appellants efforts to incite others to murder and terrorize americans reflect both his specific intent to arouse others to commit such atrocities and specific intent that such atrocities actually be committed unlike the imts reasoning in the case of hans fritzsche we find appellants position and official duties sufficiently important to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he took part in originating or formulating propaganda campaigns

discussing the imts basis for finding streicher guilty  appellants incitement during an ongoing armed conflict in which al qaeda used terror as its primary means and method of warfare clearly links his conduct to ongoing violations of the law of armed conflicts most fundamental tenets his efforts to encourage others to join al qaeda and to commit such atrocities in furtherance of al qaedas

charter art  see also id at  imt judgment describing germanys aggressive war  imt judgment discussing the law as to the common plan or conspiracy to engage in aggressive war the imt found eight defendants guilty of count one conspiracy to engage in aggressive war id at  similarly appellants incitement and efforts in support of bin laden and al qaeda to justify the intentional killing of civilians and destruction of their property based solely upon their nationality or physical presence in the united states and his actions equate to conduct and intent akin to that punishable as genocide terrorism as advocated by appellant and employed by al qaeda constitutes a modern incarnation of the insidious evils present in aggressive war and genocide and exhibit the specific intent and contextual nexus to the actions to be actionable as an offense solicitation as defined alleged and proven in this case is far removed from an inchoate offense involving mere criminal suggestion or prompting rather in its present guise it is criminal incitement recruitment indoctrination and motivation to violence deliberately targeting without distinction persons and interests of a particular nationality appellants charged conduct is an offense against the law of nations his relevant criminal conduct was prohibited under the laws of afghanistan where the conduct was committed; and the united states the object of the solicited offenses and the nation attacked by al qaeda upon consideration of the extant treaty law customary international law and general principles of law recognized by civilized nations we conclude that the government has made a substantial showing see supra n  that public solicitation inducement or advice to commit any of the charged object offenses eg to attack protected persons and property in violation of the laws of armed conflict to commit terrorism or to recruit members for or otherwise indoctrinate members in an international terrorist organization violates international norms moreover congress did not exceed the scope of its constitutional authority to define and punish offenses under the law of nations by making such conduct when committed by an auec in the context of or associated with a noninternational armed conflict punishable by military commission  appellant asserts he was convicted on the basis of political speech in violation of the first amendment he argues the first amendment bars the prosecution of political argument except in a few narrow circumstances such as incitement brief for appellant  and he avers this case does not rise to the level of incitement appellant states he is not claiming first amendment rights on the battlefield but asserts once charges were filed against him his foreign political speech is protected by the first amendment id should this court find he has no first amendment rights personally appellant argues that his prosecution for production of the destruction of the american destroyer uss cole hereinafter the video violates the first amendment because it chills the dissemination of information available to us citizens finally appellant asserts the military commission judge erred in failing to properly instruct the members on the standard for incitement or on the probative value of protected speech as evidence following the supreme courts decision in holder v humanitarian law project  us ___  sct   ledd   appellant sought and was granted leave to file a supplemental brief appellant acknowledged that the courts opinion in holder suggested that `independent advocacy can be distinguished from advocacy `in coordination with or at the direction of a terrorist organization supplemental brief on holder v humanitarian law project for appellant  citing holder  sct at  given the supreme courts determination that congress could lawfully prohibit the latter conduct appellant conceded that the clear implication of the courts opinion is that otherwise protected speech can underlie an overt act in support of a charge of  usc § b if done in the manner the court described id nevertheless appellant maintains that the governments pervasive exploitation of his thoughts   beliefs   ideals as incriminating evidence warranted special instruction from the military commission judge that his political beliefs were not on trial id citing united states v salameh  fd   d cir for the reasons discussed below we disagree we hold the first amendment does not apply to appellants conduct and if it did the first amendment was not violated further we hold the military commission judge did not err in his instruction to the members  the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law  abridging the freedom of speech us const amend i it is well established that the unconditional phrasing of the first amendment was not intended to protect every utterance roth v united states  us    sct   ledd   the supreme court has not specifically held a noncitizen speaking abroad is protected by the first amendment in fact in boumediene v bush  us    sct   ledd   justice kennedy wrote that before that decision the court has never held that noncitizens detained by our government in territory over which another country maintains de jure sovereignty have any rights under our constitution in boumediene  the supreme court concluded the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus pursuant to article i section  clause  extends to the detainees held at guantanamo bay id at   sct  it is important to note that opinion was limited to article i section  clause  and did not address any other provisions of the constitution however in order to determine if first amendment protections extend to appellant we will review recent habeas corpus jurisprudence in johnson v eisentrager  us   sct   led   the court concluded that  german citizens who had been captured in china tried and convicted of war crimes by an american military commission and incarcerated in a prison in germany had no right of habeas corpus see rasul v bush  us    sct   ledd   discussing eisentrager the eisentrager opinion was based on six factors critical to the question of the prisoners constitutional entitlements id the six factors were that the prisoner is id at   sct  citing eisentrager  us at   sct  both justice stevens and justice kennedy distinguished the six factors when applied to the detainees held at guantanamo in rasul the supreme court held that the federal courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees habeas corpus cases noting that nothing in the courts precedent categorically excludes aliens detained in military custody outside the united states from the privilege of litigation id at   sct  emphasis added in boumediene justice kennedy discussed another case involving american citizens invoking the rights of the fifth and sixth amendments to indictment and jury trial reid v covert  us   sct   led   that held the fifth and sixth amendments apply to us citizen military dependents charged with criminal conduct in a foreign country boumediene  us at   sct  in explaining why there seems to be a difference when the supreme court held the constitution applied and when it held that it did not apply justice kennedy noted practical considerations were at play in the decisions of reid for place of both confinement and trial and eisentrager postwwii reconstruction security logistics of transporting convicted germans to the us among other factors id at   sct  justice kennedy concluded in boumediene  us at    sct  the end result in boumediene and in rasul was access to a judicial forum and the privilege of litigation based upon a fundamental constitutional right the writ of habeas corpus there is a distinction to be drawn between habeas corpus rights and first amendment protections both justice stevens and justice kennedy distinguished eisentrager with respect to rights to habeas corpus and the eisentrager opinion contains comment on constitutional rights in general which proves insightful in analyzing the issue at hand in eisentrager  us at   sct  the supreme court wrote in  the supreme court held that the fourth amendment does not extend to a search by american authorities of the mexican residence of a mexican citizen and resident who had no voluntary attachment to the united states united states v verdugourquidez  us    sct   ledd   the fifth amendments privilege against self incrimination is a fundamental trial right of criminal defendants whereas the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures occurring when committed not at trial id at   sct  the court also emphasized that the first second fourth ninth and tenth amendments provide rights or powers reserved to the people id at   sct  the people relates id at   sct  the court also discussed the insular cases which held that not every constitutional provision applies to governmental activity even where the united states has sovereign power id at   sct  declining to endorse the view that every constitutional provision applies wherever the united states government exercises its power the court clarified how rights attach to the people under the constitution  in this case appellant a citizen of yemen prepared the video in afghanistan following al qaedas attack on the uss cole in  the video was shown to al qaeda recruits and trainees in afghanistan and it was and is also widely available on the internet there is no question that when he made the video appellant had no lawful connection with the united states his only subsequent connection to the united states was his capture detention and trial such a connection does not thereby recast speech made years before with first amendment protections the first amendment is not a right dealing with access to a judicial forum or one regulating procedures during a criminal proceeding but rather one concerning the freedom of speech under these facts appellant is not entitled and does not have the rights and protections provided by the first amendment  assuming arguendo appellant is entitled to the protections of the first amendment we next address the first amendment challenge to the mca appellant contends his speech was political speech and thus protected by the first amendment he cites brandenburg v ohio  us   sct   ledd   and united states v aguilar  fd   th cir and states the facts of the case at hand do not rise to the level of inciting or producing imminent lawless action brief for appellant ; reply brief  first we must examine the mca to determine if it is facially overbroad to review a law challenged on first amendment grounds the supreme court applies the overbreadth doctrine united states v williams  us   sct   ledd   id at   sct  citations omitted a law is overbroad and hence void if it does not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of state control but on the contrary sweeps within its ambit  other activities that  constitute an exercise of freedom of speech thornhill v alabama  us    sct   led   in our review of the mca we focus on the three offenses of which appellant was charged and convicted  providing material support and resources including himself to al qaeda an international terrorist organization then engaged in hostilities with the united states;  conspiring with usama bin laden and other members and associates of al qaeda to inter alia commit murder attack civilians and civilian objects in violation of the law of war commit terrorism and provide material support for terrorism; and  soliciting various persons to commit these same offenses the  mca specifically addresses offenses fundamental to a governments first duty to those governed\\x97protection of its citizens charges i and ii the conspiracy and solicitation charges are clearly speechbased offenses however as the second circuit held in rahman appellant was not immunized from prosecution for such speechbased offenses merely because one commits them through the medium of political speech if appellants speeches crossed the line into criminal solicitation procurement of criminal activity or conspiracy to violate the laws prosecution is permissible rahman  fd at  next we look to charge iii and the definition used in all three charges for providing material support for terrorism see supra n  the definition of material support includes prohibitions on certain types of speech ie training and expert advice and assistance but these prohibitions are directly connected to providing material support or resources to an international terrorist organization engaged in hostilities against the united states knowing that such organization has engaged or engages in terrorism  mca § vb the creation of propaganda and recruiting materials are within the definitions terms any product  or services and necessarily involve speech see supra p  upon review of the entire mca we find the law is specifically aimed at the crime of terrorism and that it does not intrude into an area of protected speech the mca in its absolute sense and also relative to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep is not overbroad thus we find no facial first amendment violation assuming arguendo the mca suppressed appellants political speech we will subject the mca to strict scrutiny to determine if any such restrictions further  a compelling interest and are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest see citizens united v federal election commission ___ us ___  sct    ledd   citing federal election commn

citations omitted chief justice roberts wrote the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action brandenburg  us at   sct  footnote omitted the defendant in brandenburg was convicted based upon a filmed ku klux klan rally which depicted hooded klansmen brandishing firearms parading around a burning cross and shouting despicable racial epithets the film showed the defendant proclaiming to the armed crowd if our president our congress our supreme court continues to suppress the white caucasian race its possible that there might have to be some revengeance sic taken id at   sct  quoting from an earlier decision the supreme court noted that the mere abstract teaching  of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action id at   sct  quoting noto v united states  us    sct   ledd   the court continued a statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments it sweeps within its condemnation speech which our constitution has immunized from governmental control id in reversing the conviction the supreme court held that the statute in question purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid on pain of criminal punishment assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action moreover neither the indictment nor the trial judges instructions to the jury in any way refined the statutes bald definition of the crime in terms of mere advocacy not to distinguish from incitement to imminent lawless action id at   sct  footnote omitted  the second circuit in rahman examined a host of criminal statutes that provided a crime could be committed by speech alone  fd at  it is well established that the government may criminalize certain preparatory steps towards criminal action even when the crime consists of the use of conspiratorial or exhortatory words id the second circuit held the government who possessed evidence of conspiratorial planning need not wait until buildings and tunnels have been bombed and people killed before arresting the conspirators id at  the rahman court explained id at  the following language falls outside the protections of the first amendment when rahman was talking about killing president mubarak make up with god  by turning his rifles barrel to president mubaraks chest and killing him depend on god carry out this operation it does not require a fatwa you are ready in training but do it go ahead id in consultation regarding the bombing of the united nations headquarters rahman told another yes its a must its a duty id in discussing the bombing of the un he advised that it would be bad for muslims but added that they should find a plan to destroy or to bomb or to  inflict damage to the american army id rahmans speeches were not simply the expression of ideas but in some instances constituted the crime of conspiracy to wage war on the united states and solicitation of attack on the us military installations as well as the murder of the egyptian president the second circuit concluded words of this nature\\x97ones that instruct solicit or persuade others to commit crimes of violence\\x97violate the law and are not protected by the first amendment id in united states v sattar a federal district court found the defendant guilty despite his claims the test in brandenburg was not met the defendant in sattar was charged with drafting and disseminating a fatwah to be issued under rahmans name that was entitled fatwah mandating the bloodshed of israelis everywhere and that called on brother scholars everywhere in the muslim world to do their part and issue unanimous fatwah that urges the  muslim nation to fight the jews and to kill them where ever they are sattar  fsuppd at ; see also united states v stewart  fd  d cir at   the court found these specific acts to be sufficient to support the charge that sattar solicited crimes of violence and in each case the courts held that such acts and statements that instruct solicit or persuade others to commit crimes of violence are not protected by the first amendment and may be prosecuted stewart  fd at  citing rahman  fd at ; sattar  fsuppd at  citing rahman  fd at  appellant argues that supreme court opinions have clarified that for lawless action to be `imminent the speaker must be addressing specific individuals who are intended and likely to act without further deliberation brief for appellant  citing hess v indiana  us    sct   ledd   hess is distinguishable on its facts the hess case involved a us citizen defendant who was protesting the war and blocking a street on the campus of indiana university when he was required to move by the sheriff he loudly said well take the  street later hess  us at   sct  the court held that hesss speech was not directed to any person or group of persons and found that he was not advocating in the normal sense any action id at   sct  in the case at hand although specific individuals were not named in the video appellant was clearly advocating violent lawless actions to kill and destroy against specific targets americans by an identified group muslims we note the affirmed cases of rahman and sattar discussed above contained similar threats against a specific large group or category of targets as opposed to merely threats against specifically named individuals applying strict scrutiny to the mca we conclude congress had a compelling interest in prohibiting terrorism even if it impacted certain speech congress narrowly tailored the mca to focus on criminal activities of terrorists we find appellants claim he was convicted for making political speech unpersuasive the videos purpose was to incite listeners to join al qaeda and kill americans and others appellant himself described the video as one of the best propaganda videos the al qaeda had to date  influential and produced good results for al qaeda tr  a government expert testified the video may have been the number one al qaeda propaganda video the video was repeatedly shown during training at al qaeda safehouses and terrorist training camps the video was an important training and indoctrination tool for al qaeda and is commercially available in numerous languages the obvious purpose of the video was to incite others to join al qaeda and to commit crimes against americans or other us interests or to support those who do we find the video constitutes incitement to imminent lawless action unlike brandenburg this is a case where the video goes beyond mere advocacy to that of incitement the video was aimed at inciting viewers to join al qaeda to kill americans and to cause destruction the target was quite specific all americans and american interests like rahman and  sattar the target was not limited to a specific named individual the video is an integral part of and intrinsically related to the commission of terrorism we hold appellants speech is not protected by the first amendment as political speech but is unprotected speech integrally tied to unlawful criminal activity  appellant argues that prosecution for his creation of the video has a chilling effect on us citizens in their exercise of the right to dissemination of information brief for appellant  in citizens united  sct at  the supreme court declared appellants prosecution does not adversely affect the rights of us citizens to receive such information the video is readily available on the internet and in numerous foreign languages possession or viewing of the video is not criminalized by the mca\\x97providing material support for terrorism is the conduct that is prohibited nothing in the mca prohibits access to information such as the video  appellant asserts the military commission judge failed to instruct the members of a first amendment defense that appellant could be convicted only if the video was intended and likely to bring about specific and imminent illegality this issue is raised for the first time on appeal appellant made no objection to the proposed instructions during trial and raised no issue of the need for a first amendment defense instruction pursuant to the  mmc part ii rmc f the issue is waived absent plain error see supra p  explaining plain error rule for instructions as noted above appellant has no first amendment right to commit the charged offenses thus he has no right to have the instruction provided to the members in review of the entire record we find no error let alone plain error in the military commission judges failure to sua sponte provide a first amendment defense instruction assuming arguendo that it was error since the instruction is of a constitutional dimension we will examine the issue united states v russell  us    sct   ledd   the supreme court has stated that as a general proposition a defendant is entitled to an instruction as to any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in his favor mathews v united states  us    sct   ledd   the ninth circuit found that where there is some evidence   that the purpose of the speaker or the tendency of his words are directed to ideas or consequences remote from the commission of the criminal act a defense based on the first amendment is a legitimate matter for the jurys consideration united states v freeman  fd   th cir the freeman decision established as a threshold for a first amendment jury instruction that there be some evidence that the defendants purpose or the likely effect of his words was remote from the commission of the crime a first amendment defense instruction need not be given when the words are more than  mere advocacy but are so close in time and purpose to a substantive evil as to become part of the crime itself id at   the supreme courts observation in holder is relevant to the instant case holder  sct at  we find the videos message to be more than mere advocacy as discussed above the message of the video was an incitement to imminent lawless activity a first amendment defense instruction was not required  appellant states that the military commissions act is a bill of attainder because congress has through the  mca unconstitutionally identified him as an auec and punished him by depriving him of previously enjoyed rights brief for appellant   a bill of attainder legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial the analysis necessarily requires  an inquiry into whether the three definitional elements\\x97specificity in identification punishment and lack of a judicial trial\\x97are contained in the statute obrien  us at  n   sct  the judicial function is `not to destroy the act if we can but to construe it if consistent with the will of congress so as to comport with constitutional limitations  selective service system v minnesota public interest research group  us    sct   ledd   quoting csc v letter carriers  us    sct   ledd    appellant argues that he is being punished merely for being an auec we disagree his argument misapprehends the legal significance of the auec determination although the auec determination is an element of each charged offense and a jurisdictional prerequisite his status as an auec standing alone is not punishable under the mca see supra pp  the term auec in this context is used synonymously with unprivileged enemy belligerent  mca §§ a ;  mca § a far from constituting a determination of guilt this designation identifies ones status under the law of armed conflict including the geneva conventions  mca § c;  mca § c; supra p  and n  discussing military commission jurisdiction the argument also ignores the additional procedural and substantive protections provided by the mca including the presumption of innocence and the governments burden of proving every element of each offense to include auec status beyond a reasonable doubt by legal and competent evidence the mca as implemented through the mmc explicitly provides inter alia for example the presumption of innocence the right to have the auec finding and guilt determined beyond a reasonable doubt by impartial members and the right to appellate review  and  mca §§ a; lc; c see also infra n ; see also eg  mmc part ii rcm            chapters xxii listing numerous rights of the accused to a fair trial and substantial posttrial rights  appellant also asserts that his punishment is the deprivation of rights that he previously enjoyed specifically he claims that before his status as an auec he somehow enjoyed the rights to confront evidence against him to petition for writ of habeas corpus and to protection against selfincrimination under the constitution of the united states of america brief for appellant  he also asserts that his status as an auec deprived him of his previously enjoyed rights under the geneva conventions id at  the supreme court has recognized three tests when analyzing whether a statute inflicts forbidden punishment historical functional and motivational tests nixon  us at   sct  therefore the inquiry requires the court to determine  whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment;  whether the statute viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes; and  whether the legislative record evinces a congressional intent  to punish selective service system  us at   sct  quotation omitted  in nixon the supreme court articulated the historical test standard by describing the history of bills of attainder nixon  us at   sct  in england bills of attainder originally connoted a parliamentary act sentencing named individual or identifiable members of a group to death id however the prohibition against bills of attainder also proscribes enactments originally characterized as bill of pains and penalties that is legislative acts inflicting punishment other than execution id at   sct  the court stated that our countrys own experience with bills of attainder resulted in the addition of another sanction to the list of impermissible legislative punishments a legislative enactment barring designated individuals or groups from participation in specified employments or vocations id appellant relies on cases which have expanded the notion of punishment to incorporate employment rights but those have little relevance here in lovett the supreme court struck down a law designed to permanently bar three named executive employees from government service based on their congressionallydetermined political beliefs lovett  us at   sct  a special subcommittee of the appropriations committee which charged those individuals with subversive beliefs and associations adjudicated their cases in secret executive sessions where those charged were not permitted to be present or represented by counsel id at   sct  the court found that the law inflicted punishment without the safeguards of a judicial trial id at   sct  the court listed certain procedural safeguards required to ensure the people of this country are not subjected to punishment without trial including the following rights to be tried by a jury; to confront witnesses; to be represented by counsel; to be informed of the charges; to the right against selfincrimination; to not be subjected to double jeopardy the ex post facto application of laws or cruel and unusual punishment id at   sct  despite the fact that appellant is an auec the mca provides the very procedural safeguards identified by the supreme court as required for citizens of this country to have a fair trial  and  mca §§ ; see also infra n  in each case cited by appellant as support for historicallyrecognized punishment the decisions were based on us citizens whose discernable rights were permanently denied without the requisite due process as such each case is readily and necessarily distinguishable further the geneva conventions do not establish a private right of action as appellant asserts; however the united states has obligated itself to abide by those conventions  mca § be the supreme court held in hamdan v rumsfeld  us   sct   ledd   that common article  of the geneva conventions is applicable in military commissions and noted that the united states must fulfill its obligations id at   sct  we conclude that the military commission convened here under the  mca qualified as a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples see hamdan  fsuppd at  n   wl  at  n  quoting article d of gciii supra n  the military commissions authorized in the mca afford extensive procedural guarantees including the right to counsel rights to present and respond to evidence and to present  and crossexamine witnesses the presumption of innocence and the right against selfincrimination congress in the mca also provided defendants the right to be present during trial proceedings the right to appeal to this court as well as the automatic right to appeal to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the right to petition the supreme court of the united states and the right to have a military commission judge preside over the trial see supra n  assuming arguendo that common article  grants privately enforceable rights the mca affords those rights the mca does not summarily impose punishment but rather provides a system by which to determine personal and subject matter jurisdiction guilt or innocence and appropriate punishment under the mca appellant enjoys benefits which exceed those required by common article  such as the rights to a public trial by members to have witnesses produced for his trial to limitations on admissibility of evidence to raise affirmative defenses among many other rights see hamdan v rumsfeld  us at   sct ; mca §§ ; see also supra n  just as the court stated in nixon we too find here that no feature of the challenged act falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment nixon  us at   sct  appellant argues that congress unconstitutionally denied him eight previously available rights however appellant fails to articulate any viable legal support for his assertion of those rights  the functional test analyzes whether nonpunitive legislative purposes are reasonably furthered given the burdens imposed id at   sct  considering the facts and circumstances and the purpose of the mca just as in nixon legitimate justifications for the passage of the act are readily apparent appellant argues that the mca sought to reverse holdings of the supreme court as to the rights enjoyed by a known class of litigants brief for appellant  as previously stated the mca defines the class of individuals subject to the jurisdiction of military commissions we hold that by defining auecs for jurisdictional purposes and limiting jurisdiction thereto the mca is an act of nonpunitive legislative policy making nixon  us at   sct   the third recognized test of punishment is strictly a motivational one inquiring whether the legislative record evinces a congressional intent to punish id at   sct  appellant cites remarks from congressional floor debates and hearings as support of congressional intent to pass the mca as a punitive  measure brief for appellant  even the broadest reading of these congressional records cast no aspersions on appellants personal conduct and contain no condemnation of his behavior as meriting the infliction of punishment nixon  us at   sct  rather they focus on the desire to protect americans and americas national security while also protecting human dignity brief for appellant  citing statement of sen grassley  cong rec s  appellant contends that what distinguishes bills of attainder from congress legitimate authority to make distinctions between classes of offenders is whether congress is legislating `by rules of general applicability brief for appellant  citing united states v brown  us    sct   ledd   arguing the specificity requirement appellant states that congress may legislate by rules of general applicability and that it cannot specify the people upon whom the sanction it prescribes to be levied brown  us at   sct  nor can congress designate persons described in terms of conduct which because it is past conduct operates only as a designation of particular persons selective service system  us at   sct  citations omitted however the nixon court cautioned against extending the already broad and generous  protection against bills of attainder by presuming that the constitution is offended whenever a law imposes undesired consequences on an individual or on a class that is not defined at a proper level of generality nixon  us at   sct  the supreme court continued to articulate the standard stating id at   sct  footnote and citations omitted additionally appellant argues that because there is nothing he can do to avoid the label of auec the law is an unconstitutional bill of attainder brief for appellant  however appellant fails to articulate how his status determination as an auec which initially serves as a jurisdictional predicate constitutes punishment the supreme court has expressly recognized that even if the specificity element were deemed satisfied    the statute would not necessarily implicate the bill of attainder clause selective service system  us at   sct  appellant correctly states that auec is a status brief for appellant  status as  an auec is not punishment rather by defining the class of individuals subject to the jurisdiction of the mca congress is exercising its inherent power under constitutional authority to define and punish offences against the law of nations us const art i §  cl  the definitions of auec in the  mca see supra nn    and unprivileged enemy belligerent in the  mca see supra n  do not determine guilt or inflict punishment as a bill of attainder  finally appellant argues that because the auec status was devised in the midst of an intensely contested congressional election and the fifth anniversary of the september th attacks the mca did not establish a regularly constituted court brief for appellant  although appellant alleges that the mca substituted a legislative for a judicial determination of guilt nothing in his arguments suggest that congress was intent on encroaching on the judicial function of punishing an individual for blameworthy offenses nixon  us at   sct  though more recent cases analyze whether punishment was administered without a judicial trial historically the inquiry and concern was whether the legislative enactment created the deprivation without any of the ordinary forms and guards provided for the security of the citizen in the administration of justice by the established tribunals cummings  us at   us  congress properly acted within its enumerated power to enact legislation that gives substantive and procedural rights for the administration of justice in this case congress had no obligation under the bill of attainder clause to establish courts or military commissions or tribunals identical to an article iii court  the mca is not a bill of attainder as it lawfully establishes comprehensive procedures for the impartial adjudication of guilt required by the constitution and the law of armed conflict  we resolve this assignment of error against appellant for the reasons stated in hamdan  fsuppd at   wl  at   the government asserts that appellant waived the first amendment ex post facto bill of attainder and equal protection challenges raised in his appeal by failing to raise those issues below brief for appellee  specifically the government  argues appellants failure to raise these issues at trial trial defense counsels express waiver of all pretrial motions of any kind and confirmation of that waiver in response to the military judges explicit inquiry waives further consideration of those issues id citing united states v mezzanatto  us    sct   ledd  ; peretz v united states  us    sct   ledd   and  mmc part ii rcm e appellant responds that the government is wrong for three reasons appellants reply of  november  at  first appellants challenges are not subject to implied waiver specifically the first amendment challenge issue addresses the constitutional interests of society as a whole and as such appellate courts are obligated to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression id at  quoting bose corp v consumers union of the us  us    sct   ledd   he also asserts the ex post facto bill of attainder and equal protection challenges are jurisdictional in nature and thus not subject to waiver id citing curtis pub co v butts  us   sct   ledd   first amendment; milhouse v levi  fd  dccir ex post facto ; united states v jones  fd  dccir  due process second the record does not support a conclusion that he knowingly or voluntarily waived those issues or empowered trial defense counsel to do so on his behalf id at  specifically that trial defense counsels acknowledgements that appellant did not wish to be represented by counsel to have no further communication with counsel and that appellant did not authorize  trial defense counsel to speak on his behalf or to represent him in any way  reflect that trial defense counsel was not empowered to waive those issues appellant also argues that the military judge effectively allowed him to represent himself that he raised the issues in controversy in colloquies with the military judge that the military judge did not inform him of the purported waiver or ask what he wanted to do and instead broadly referred to his boycott as preserving appellate challenges to the military commissions act mca id third application of waiver is a matter of discretion for this court and our duty to ensure that findings are correct in law and fact counsels against waiver  the  mca

waiver or forfeiture nerad  mj at  citing united states v claxton  mj   cmaapproving court of criminal appeals decision ordering rehearing in light of evidentiary error under circumstances in which waiver would ordinarily preclude relief  the governments argument and appellants reply raise potentially complex and wideranging issues including applicability of the principles of waiver and forfeiture to a military commission convened under the  mca and of defense counsels authority and responsibility when an accused voluntarily absents himself from a proceeding having repeatedly recorded his objections to counsels performance of any role as his defense counsel at trial the appellant failed to make the timely assertion of the first amendment ex post facto bill of attainder and equal protection challenges before the military commission there were no specific motions requests defenses or objections to that effect raised before the commission was adjourned as required by rmc e the record also reveals ambiguity surrounding detailed defense counsels authority to act in appellants stead when he waived all motions and the absence of explicit on the record discussion of the effect of or appellants understanding of his voluntary absence on motions defenses or objections having previously addressed the substance of appellants challenges and having found those challenges without merit we need not decide whether he forfeited or waived those challenges  appellant argues that as a media man he was effectively sentenced to life without  parole for producing a video writing speeches and providing techsupport brief on sentence appropriateness for appellant  he contends that the sentence imposed is inappropriately severe for the offenses of which he was convicted and in comparison to sentences of other closely related cases involving al qaeda members who were sentenced to brief terms of years for personally perpetrating acts of violence id he further asserts that his detention will continue irrespective of whether he is sentenced or even convicted of any crime and that this court should reduce his sentence to a reasonable term of years that reflects the comparative seriousness of his conduct rather than the offensiveness of his beliefs id at  the government responds that the adjudged sentence is fair and just given appellants character and the nature and seriousness of his crimes and requests this court to affirm the sentence as approved by the convening authority the government also asserts that appellant mischaracterizes his sentence to confinement as life without parole and erroneously suggests that the president is deprived of authority to grant clemency or parole in such a case we find both appellants characterization of his conduct advanced with a decidedly contentneutral view and his arguments unpersuasive we also decline to entertain appellants argument that he will be indefinitely detained regardless of his conviction and sentence as it is irrelevant this is a matter for the political branches and beyond the scope of our authority and responsibility in determining sentence appropriateness  mca § fd  the  mca requires this court to make a de novo determination of the appropriateness of the sentence imposed  mca § fd we may affirm only such  sentence or such part or amount of the sentence as we find correct

precedent on this issue we adopt as our own the following fundamental premises articulated and applied by those courts each sentence is judged on the basis of the nature and seriousness of the offense

execution of this highly discretionary function we are neither required to nor precluded from considering sentences in other cases even when those cases are not closely related   appellant was convicted contrary to his pleas of  providing material support and resources including himself to al qaeda an international terrorist organization then engaged in hostilities with the united states;  conspiring with bin laden and other members and associates of al qaeda to inter alia commit murder in violation of the law of war attack civilians and civilian objects commit terrorism and provide material support for terrorism; and  soliciting various persons to commit these same offenses all charged offenses allege a nexus to al qaeda during the period february  through december  the nature and seriousness of these offenses are manifest in the charges themselves the objects of both the conspiracy and solicitation charges include committing murder in violation of the law of war attacking civilians and civilian objects committing terrorism  and providing material support for terrorism at trial the members were presented with overwhelming uncontested evidence that appellant was guilty with much of the evidence provided by appellant in the form of voluntary admissions to investigators appellant also essentially admitted the same in his unsworn statement to the members during the presentencing hearing in his voluntary statements to investigators appellant admitted on multiple occasions to traveling to afghanistan with the intent to join al qaeda undergoing militarytype training at an al qaeda sponsored camp and meeting with bin laden following his training during that meeting appellant admitted discussing bin ladens views on islam and jihad against the united states agreeing with those views and then pledging personal loyalty to bin laden he then joined al qaeda as a member worked in al qaedas media office and eventually took charge of that office where he performed a number of acts to recruit to incite others to join al qaeda and to indoctrinate prospective al qaeda recruits into the al qaeda plan appellant readily admitted developing and producing a videotape at the personal request of bin laden capitalizing on al qaedas perfidious attack on the uss cole in an effort to recruit and indoctrinate prospective members into al qaeda that videotape identified the united states as a source of muslim suffering worldwide and demanded as a religious duty other muslims to migrate to afghanistan and engage in jihad against the united states and others it was also described as one of the most if not the most important propaganda products produced by al qaeda to recruit incite and motivate potential terrorists including suicide bombers evidence that al qaeda was responsible for the / attacks on the united states was also overwhelming and uncontested by appellant the record clearly reflects that  men recruited by al qaeda hijacked  commercial airliners and crashed those aircraft into the pentagon in washington dc the world trade center in new york and into a field in pennsylvania those attacks resulted in the deaths of thousands of people appellants conduct is directly linked to those attacks in that he facilitated the personal pledges of loyalty to bin laden of two / hijackers/pilots muhammed atta and ziad al jarrah and prepared their propaganda declarations styled as martyr wills also he maintained and operated the media equipment used to inform bin laden of completion of those attacks and at bin ladens personal request he researched the economic effect of those attacks on the united states and provided that research to bin laden appellant was also convicted of intentionally providing material support or resources to al qaeda an international terrorist organization engaged in hostilities against the united states knowing that al qaeda had engaged in or engages in terrorism including the august  attacks on us embassies in kenya and tanzania these attacks also resulted in hundreds of deaths thousands of injuries and extensive property damage the members concluded by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant with the requisite knowledge and intent provided himself as a member to al qaeda traveled to afghanistan to join al qaeda met with al qaeda leadership underwent militarytype training at an al qaeda sponsored camp and met with and pledged personal loyalty to bin laden the members also found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant provided services in direct support of bin laden and al qaeda including preparing various propaganda products intended for al qaeda recruiting;  indoctrination training and inciting persons to commit terrorism; facilitating the pledges of loyalty to bin laden and preparing the martyr wills for two suspected september   hijackers/pilots; researching the economic effect of those attacks on the united states and providing the results to bin laden; and operating and maintaining data processing equipment and media communications equipment for the benefit of bin laden and other al qaeda leaders the record reflects that appellant was in his s married with a family intelligent welleducated and that he traveled to afghanistan to join al qaeda with knowledge that al qaeda had engaged in terrorism and was engaged in hostilities with the united states the record also reflects that armed with that knowledge and following militarylike training provided by al qaeda appellant fulfilled his desire to join al qaeda after personally meeting with saifal adel and bin laden and discussing their beliefs and goals he pledged loyalty to bin laden and remained devoted to bin laden and al qaeda throughout the charged timeframe and for more than six years following his capture and detention up to the day he was sentenced appellants words and actions at trial particularly his unsworn statement to the members reveal his unwavering commitment to violence including the intentional killing of civilians and attacks on protected persons and places tr  appellants unsworn statement; appellate ex  appellants declaration of renewal of the allegiance to usama bin laden the military commission judge properly advised the members that in determining an appropriate sentence they should consider that society recognizes five principle reasons for the sentence of those who violate the law  rehabilitation of the wrongdoer  punishment of the wrongdoer  protection of society from the wrongdoer  preservation of societal order and  deterrence of the wrongdoer and those who know of his crimes and his sentence from committing the same or similar offenses tr  the military commission judge properly instructed the members on the presentencing procedures including the evidence and appellants unsworn statement tr   sentencing instructions;  mmc part ii rmc  we are unmoved by appellants argument that he was a media man who was sentenced to confinement for life without parole for producing a video writing speeches and providing techsupport and that his being a shockjock does not make him deserving of life without parole sentence appropriateness brief for appellant  we also decline appellants invitation to assess the appropriateness of the sentence from his perspective a perspective which deliberately displaces the incitement to violence intended by the propaganda he produced in deference to focus on the technical skills used in producing that propaganda this argument grossly understates the significance of appellants contributions to al qaeda and appellants own opinion thereof both perhaps were best summed up in appellants own words i asked bin laden for a martyrdom operation suicide operation but he refused the reason why he refused was that  recruiting people through media gets you more people than suicidal attacks sic tr  and that i was to be the th hijacker but bin laden refused tr  appellants contributions to al qaeda were of strategic significance to recruiting indoctrination retention and inciting others to support or join al qaeda he was more valuable in media or strategic communications than in suicide operations in the case of two / hijackers/pilots he directly facilitated their quest to kill themselves  and as many others as they could in furtherance of al qaedas goals after carefully considering the entire record of trial the nature and seriousness of these offenses and the matters presented by appellant we find the sentence to be appropriate for this offender and his offenses  appellant also asserts that the sentence is inappropriately severe in comparison to closelyrelated cases involving al qaeda members who were sentenced to brief terms of years for personally perpetrating acts of violence appellant notes that of the three individuals sentenced by military commission at the time of filing he is the only one to receive a life sentence a sentence that he contends is tantamount to confinement for life without the possibility of parole appellant argues that there were two closely related cases involving al qaeda members who were sentenced to brief terms of years for personally perpetrating acts of violence sentence appropriateness brief for appellant  in the first case united states v hamdan hamdan was sentenced to  months confinement and served less than five months posttrial punitive confinement after applying credit for time served appellant asserts that hamdan was convicted on the basis of being an armed body guard to bin laden and an al qaeda weapons courier id at  in the second case united states v hicks appellant asserts that the members returned a sevenyear sentence for which all but nine months was suspended pursuant to a guilty plea agreement id appellant contends that hicks conceded that despite owing allegiance as an australian to a coalition allied to the united states he shopped himself around to various terrorist organizations in afghanistan and ultimately served as a taliban fighter guarding their positions and personally engaging coalition forces in combat id appellant has failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating that the hicks case was closely related to his case appellant did not establish that he and hicks were involved in a common crime or that they were in a common or parallel scheme nor did he prove any other direct nexus between himself and hicks lacy  mj at  additionally hicks was involved in fighting with the taliban pleaded guilty and accepted some responsibility for his actions thereby providing a rational basis for any disparity in sentencing even assuming the cases were closely related even a cursory comparison of the two cases reveals significant differences in that hicks pleaded guilty and was found guilty of only one specification of one charge providing material support to terrorism and the suspended sentence was predicated on multiple conditions of his cooperation military commission order number  dod office of the military commissions  may  appellants argument with respect to hamdan bears a closer resemblance in that both were members of al qaeda who pledged loyalty to bin laden and provided varying forms of support directly to bin laden and al qaeda neither membership in an organization such as al qaeda nor conduct in support of al qaeda standing alone shall mandate treatment as closely related however as both appellant and hamdan were members of al qaeda who performed substantial duties in direct support of and in close proximity to bin laden we will assume without deciding that these cases are closely related based upon the variance in the sentences we will also assume that the sentences are highly disparate and determine whether there is a rational basis for the disparity lacy  mj at   under the facts presented the basis for a disparity in sentence is readily apparent while hamdan may appropriately be referred to as a foot soldier who provided personal services including physical security and driver services for bin laden as well as courier services in transporting weapons appellant is clearly of strategic significance to al qaedas propaganda and recruiting efforts appellees sentence appropriateness brief at  appellant was more significant to al qaedas broader purposes and sustainment as a terrorist enterprise and his impact both more insidious and more likely to have a significant impact than hamdan although hamdan no doubt contributed to al qaedas activities his impact was more localized and limited and he lacked appellants technical acumen and strategic vision appellants conduct was more strategic and international in scope and he intended to inspire and motivate an untold number of individuals to join or otherwise provide support to al qaeda his behavior and statements at trial show no remorse and reflect his limited rehabilitative potential we conclude that each aforementioned distinction provides a rational basis for the disparity in the sentences id accordingly we find the sentence correct in law and fact and on the basis of the entire record conclude that it should be approved  the findings and approved sentence are affirmed brand gallagher sims perlak and orr jj concur judge sims filed a separate opinion concurring judge sims concurring although i

this field manual predates  the existence of alqaeda the birth of appellant the events of september   the enactment of the military commissions acts and appellants trial by military commission although the manual does not have the force of binding legal precedent it nonetheless serves as persuasive evidence of the view of the united states as to the state of the law of armed conflict from the aftermath of world war ii through the cold war and to the present accordingly when a person such as appellant chooses to commit any of the aforementioned acts against the united states he or she

international law case law precedent both international and domestic and the mca is a matter well within the professional capacity of a military judge it is against this legal backdrop that we now examine the significance of mr khadrs  csrt classification as an enemy combatant the subsequent referral of criminal charges against him to a military commission and the military judges sua sponte dismissal of those charges without prejudice  appellants appeal requires us to address two important issues first whether the military judge erred in ruling that mr khadrs september  csrt classification as an enemy combatant was insufficient to satisfy the congressionally mandated requirement established in the mca that military commission jurisdiction shall exist solely over offenses committed by alien unlawful enemy combatants see mca §§ c and da second if we answer the first question negatively we must determine whether the military judge erred in ruling that neither the military commission nor the military judge were empowered under the mca to receive evidence and thereafter assess mr khadrs status as an alien unlawful enemy combatant for purposes  of determining the commissions criminal jurisdiction over him  section d of the mca defines the jurisdictional limits of military commissions stating italics added the military judge in this case dismissed all charges and specifications without prejudice against mr khadr based upon his conclusion that the jurisdictional provisions of mca § d had not been met the judge correctly noted that the mca appeared to be clear in limiting jurisdiction for trial by military commission solely to unlawful enemy combatants and excluding from a commissions jurisdiction any lawful enemy combatants who instead must be tried under the provisions of the uniform code of military justice  usc §§  et seq we agree with the military judge that mr  khadrs  csrt classification as an enemy combatant failed to meet the mcas jurisdictional requirements in that it did not establish that mr khadr was in fact an unlawful enemy combatant to satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite for trial by military commission under mca § c only an alien unlawful enemy combatant is subject to trial by military commission the mca in § aa defines unlawful enemy combatant as follows appellant contends mr khadrs designation as an enemy combatant by his csrt in  was itself sufficient to establish the military commissions jurisdiction and that the military judge erred in ruling otherwise in its motion asking the military judge to reconsider his dismissal action appellant argued that the judge failed to give proper consideration and deference to a white house memorandum signed by president bush in february  which in appellants view declared all members of the taliban and al qaeda to be unlawful combatants under the geneva conventions see prosecution motion for reconsideration of june   at ; see also brief on behalf of appellant at  ¶ c appellant makes a similar argument regarding a july  memorandum from the deputy secretary of defense then mr paul wolfowitz to the secretary of the navy establishing the procedures to be employed for csrts and summarily declaring according to appellant congress enacted the mca fully aware of the  white house memorandum and the  wolfowitz memorandum including the definitional provisions and declarations contained in both appellant argues that it was the clear intent of congress to adopt the memorandas categorical declarations of combatant status regarding members of the taliban and al qaeda and that csrt determinations of enemy combatant status made prior to the adoption of the mca are sufficient to establish military commission jurisdiction see brief on behalf of appellant at  to  buttress these assertions appellant has directed us to rmc b which discusses in personam military commission jurisdiction and declares a finding whether before on or after the date of the enactment of the military commissions act of  by a csrt or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the president or the secretary of defense that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant is dispositive for purposes of jurisdiction for trial by a military commission under the mca appellant also highlights the following statement contained in the nonbinding discussion to rmc  regarding csrt determinations from the presidents  white house memorandum the  wolfowitz memorandum and this nonbinding discussion to rmc  we are now asked to categorically equate the administrations prior pronouncements regarding members of the taliban and al qaeda and use of the term enemy combatant throughout the csrt process with unlawful enemy combatant as defined in the mca and attribute that extrapolation to the clear intent of congress in this regard appellant invites us to interpret the parenthetical language contained in mca § aai\\x97including a person who is part of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces\\x97as evidence that congress statutorily ratified the presidents prior determination and that this crucial parenthetical established as a matter of statute that a member of al qaeda or the taliban\\x97without more\\x97is an `unlawful enemy combatant who can be tried by military commission supplemental brief on behalf of appellant at  in light of the plain language of the mca and applying common logic and reasoning we decline to accept the appellants position we believe the congress well aware of the fact that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure see hamdan  us at   sct at   ledd at  citing ex parte quirin  us    sct   led   was abundantly clear in precisely establishing the jurisdictional prerequisites it intended to mandate prior to any criminal proceeding before such a commission could occur as with all matters of statutory interpretation we look first and foremost to the language contained in the statute itself see duncan v walker  us    sct   ledd  ; williams v taylor  us    sct   ledd   in doing so we give the words contained in the text their ordinary meaning and interpret the statute in a manner that does not render words or phrases superfluous unless no other reasonable interpretation can be made it is unequivocally clear to us from the plain language  of the mca that congress intended trials by military commission to be utilized solely and exclusively to try only alien unlawful enemy combatants the mcas jurisdictional provisions §§ c and d and definitions section § aai make this intent perfectly clear so also does the mcas express admonition in § db that military commissions shall not have jurisdiction to try a lawful enemy combatant congress further stated that a csrts or other competent tribunals determination that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant would be dispositive for purposes of establishing jurisdiction for trial by military commission see mca § dc no such statement is made regarding a prior designation of a detainee as simply an enemy combatant and in our opinion such designation is not useful in resolving this ultimate issue of criminal jurisdiction under the mca congress was undoubtedly aware of the white house  and wolfowitz  memoranda when they wrote and enacted the mca in  this is yet another case where congress in the proper exercise of its powers as an independent branch of government and as part of a long tradition of legislative involvement in matters of military justice has considered the subject of military tribunals and set limits on the presidents authority where a statute provides the conditions for the exercise of governmental power its requirements are the result of a deliberative and reflective process engaging both of the political branches hamdan  us at   sct at   ledd at  kennedy j concurring had congress intended prior designations of detainees as mere enemy combatants to be sufficient to establish military commission jurisdiction it was fully capable of saying this in the legislation it did not indeed neither the white house nor wolfowitz memoranda are ever referenced in the mca in our opinion congress clearly aware of the previously troubled military commission process\\x97and armed with affirmative guidance from the supreme court provided in the june  decision in hamdan v rumsfeld\\x97sought to enact new clear and unequivocal legislation to unambiguously guide and successfully implement trials by military commissions  we find no support for appellants claim that congress through the mca created a comprehensive system which sought to embrace and adopt all prior csrt determinations that resulted in enemy combatant status assignments and summarily turn those designations into findings that persons so labeled could also properly be considered unlawful enemy combatants similarly we find no support for appellants position regarding the parenthetical language contained in § aai of the mca\\x97including a person who is part of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces we do not read this language as declaring that a member of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces is per se an unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction before a military commission we read the parenthetical comment as simply elaborating upon the sentence immediately preceding it that is that a member of the taliban al qaeda or associated forces who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents will also qualify as an unlawful enemy combatant under the mca emphasis added this interpretation is consistent with § b of the mca which describes the general purpose of military commissions as existing to try alien unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the united states for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission italics added critical to this analysis is the understanding that\\x97 unlike the white house and wolfowitz memoranda both of which declared enemy combatant status solely for purposes of continued detention of personnel captured during hostilities and applicability of the geneva conventions\\x97congress in the mca was carefully and deliberately defining status for the express purpose of specifying the in personam criminal jurisdiction of military commission trials in defining what was clearly intended to be limited jurisdiction congress also prescribed serious criminal sanctions for those members of this select group who were ultimately convicted by military commissions contrary to the claims in appellants briefs the  white house memorandum never affirmatively declared members of al qaeda to be unlawful enemy combatants in the memorandum the president simply stated i also accept the legal conclusion of the department of justice and determine that none of the provisions of geneva apply to our conflict with al qaeda in afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world because among other reasons al qaeda is not a high contracting party to  geneva white house memorandum at  ¶ a the memorandum later states that because geneva does not apply to our conflict with al qaeda al qaeda detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war id at  ¶ d it is reasonable to assume that congress would seek to affirmatively declare the circumstances under which individual members of al qaeda could become unlawful enemy combatants for purposes of exacting criminal liability under the mca limiting criminal responsibility solely to an individual including a member of al qaeda or the taliban or associated forces who actually engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents appears to be the clear intent of congress and requires more than mere membership in an organization for criminal responsibility to attach regarding the taliban the  white house memorandum pronounced the provisions of geneva will apply to our present conflict with the taliban id at ¶ b however it then declared that the taliban detainees are unlawful combatants and therefore do not qualify as prisoners of war under article  of geneva id at ¶ d this decision was based upon the talibans failure to comply with fundamental law of war requirements again congress clearly aware of this language appears to have decided that only a taliban member who actually engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents should be subject to trial by military commission to accept appellants interpretation would allow criminal jurisdiction at a military commission to attach to members of the taliban or al qaeda who had never engaged in or supported hostilities finally the  white house memorandum concluded that common article  of the geneva conventions does not apply to either al qaeda or taliban detainees id at ¶ c the supreme court subsequently determined that legal conclusion was erroneous see hamdan  us at   sct at   ledd at  congress clearly aware of the hamdan decision when it drafted the  mca appears to have embraced the minimal safeguards guaranteed by common article  requiring that even unlawful enemy combatants be tried by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples see § bf mca quoting common article \\x97a military commission established under this chapter is a regularly constituted court affording all the necessary `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples for purposes of common article  of the geneva conventions; see also art iii gpw iii ¶ d no serious legal authority would contest the notion that one of the most indispensable and important judicial guarantees among civilized nations honoring a tradition of due process and fundamental fairness is the right to adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in regard to allegations which might result in criminal sanctions the mca did not exist until october  mr khadr could not have known at the time of his csrt in  that a determination of enemy combatant status pursuant to declarations contained in the  white house memorandum or definitions contained in the  wolfowitz memorandum could dispositively qualify him two years after the fact for potential criminal liability before a military commission as an unlawful enemy combatant we need not speculate how mr khadrs personal participation in his  csrt evaluation may have been impacted had he been on notice of the potential criminal liability the csrts findings could impose upon him such lack of notice offends our most basic and fundamental notions of due process; therefore it also violates common article  the declared purpose of the csrt process used to review the status of hundreds of foreign national detainees captured in iraq and afghanistan and currently held under defense department control at guantanamo bay naval base cuba\\x97including mr khadr\\x97was solely to afford detainees the opportunity to contest designation as an enemy combatant wolfowitz memorandum at  the wolfowitz memorandum never discusses addressing the issue of lawful or unlawful enemy combatant status; nor does the memorandum from the secretary of the navy implementing the csrt process as far as we can discern the csrts were never tasked with making that determination instead they conducted nonadversarial proceedings aimed at deciding by a preponderance of the evidence whether each detainee met the criteria for designation as an enemy combatant under the definition in the wolfowitz memorandum to permit continued detention at guantanamo bay id at  in doing so mr khadrs  csrt employed a less exacting standard than that contained in the mca for establishing unlawful enemy combatant status a detainee could be classified as an enemy combatant under the csrt definition simply by being a part of the taliban or al qaeda without ever having engaged in or supported hostilities against the united states or its coalition partners id while such a classification would certainly be appropriate for authorizing continued detention during ongoing hostilities it does not address in any way the lawful or unlawful nature of the detained combatants belligerency under the mca congress never stated that mere membership in or affiliation with the taliban al qaeda or associated forces was a sufficient basis for declaring someone to be an unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction over that person in the mca military commission jurisdiction is limited solely to those who actually engaged in hostilities or who  purposefully and materially supported hostilities see § aaiemphasis added while mr khadrs csrt may have had more than sufficient evidence before it to properly classify him as an alien unlawful enemy combatant it was not charged with making that determination and could not have applied the definition established by congress as it did not come into existence until october \\x97two years later we will apply the clear and unambiguous jurisdictional language congress provided in the mca doing so we affirm the military judges conclusion that mr khadrs csrt classification in  as an enemy combatant was insufficient to establish the military commissions criminal jurisdiction over him  we next examine the military judges determination that the military commission is not the proper authority under the provisions of the mca to determine that mr khadr is an unlawful enemy combatant in order to establish initial jurisdiction for this commission to try mr khadr see military judges order on jurisdiction of june   at ; record at  a brief chronology of the procedural evolution of this military commission illuminates the judges ultimate ruling   after ruling that mr khadrs csrt classification as an enemy combatant was insufficient to establish the military commissions jurisdiction over him the military judge went on to conclude that he was not empowered to independently decide the matter of in personam jurisdiction because the mca requires that determination be made in advance for there to be jurisdiction to refer charges against the accused this is what congress directed and the military judge lacks authority to ignore this mandate disposition of prosecution motion for reconsideration ae  at  ¶ a after affirmatively concluding that neither he nor the military commission was authorized to render a determination on mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status and that such a determination had to be made as a prerequisite to referral the military judge faulted appellant for not presenting proof at the military commission hearing of mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status or requesting a continuance to more thoroughly brief the issue id at ¶¶ a & b in his ruling he also categorically rejected the implication that the prosecution was not allowed to present argument or evidence on jurisdiction id at ¶ b he then decided that the military commission did not have jurisdiction id at ¶ a we hold the military judge erred in two respects first in not affording appellant the opportunity to present evidence in support of its position on the jurisdictional issue before the military commission; and second in concluding that a csrt or another competent tribunal determination of unlawful enemy combatant status was a prerequisite to referral of charges to a military commission and that the military commission lacked the power to independently consider and decide this important jurisdictional matter under the mca  we review a military judges decision in regard to admitting or excluding evidence utilizing an abuse of discretion standard united states v billings   mj   caaf; see also general electric co v joiner  us    sct   ledd   the abuse of discretion standard of review recognizes that a judge has a range of choices in such matters and will not be reversed so long as the decision remains within that range united states v gore  mj   caafciting united states v wallace  fd   n  dccir ; united states v mccollum  mj   caaf applying this standard is also appropriate in reviewing a judges decisions regarding evidence production during a motion hearing or at trial both the record of trial and the military judges actions and rulings in this case demonstrate that the prosecution was not afforded the opportunity to present evidence to establish the military commissions in personam jurisdiction over mr khadr although the assistant prosecutor argued the military commission should interpret mr khadrs  csrt enemy combatant classification as satisfying the mcas jurisdictional language he also articulated a clear alternative position on the record see record at  record at  the assistant prosecutor then specifically listed the evidence the government would present in support of mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status which inter alia included a videotape of mr khadr engaged in unlawful combat activities including wearing civilian attire and making and planting roadside bombs admissions made by mr khadr and other statements that implicated him in conducting such unlawful activities record at  the military judge did not allow the government to present their evidence and instead inquired whether anyone thought about going back and doing new combatant status review tribunals record at  then after a very brief recess the military judge immediately announced his ruling on his own sua sponte motion and dismissed the charges without prejudice record at  we disagree with the military judges statement in his ruling on the motion for reconsideration that the prosecution did not make a formal offer of proof concerning any of the evidence which it now proposes be used disposition of prosecution motion for reconsideration ae  at  ¶ b the record demonstrates appellant offered and was ready to present evidence to affirmatively establish the military commissions jurisdiction over mr khadr but was summarily denied that opportunity the record does not support the assertion that the military judge afforded the prosecution an opportunity to present evidence on the jurisdiction and that they failed to do so asking counsel whether they have anything else to say  in oral argument upon a pending motion is not the equivalent of an invitation or offer to present evidence id at ¶ b; see eg record at  indeed oral argument upon a motion should rarely take place at all prior to evidence regarding the factual matters in dispute first being adduced at the motion hearing finally if there was any genuine confusion on this matter at the initial session of mr khadrs military commission appellants subsequent motion for reconsideration made it clear the prosecution was and remains fully prepared to present evidence that would clearly establish jurisdiction over the accused prosecution motion for reconsideration of june   at  for these reasons and those addressed in the next section of this opinion we find the military judge abused his discretion in deciding this critical jurisdictional matter without first fully considering both the admissibility and merits of evidence appellant offered to present on this issue  we also conclude that the military judge erred in ruling he lacked authority under the mca to determine whether mr khadr is an unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of establishing the military commissions initial jurisdiction to try him see military judges order on jurisdiction of june   at ; record at  the unambiguous language of the mca in conjunction with a clear and compelling line of federal precedent on the issue of establishing jurisdiction in federal courts convince us the military judge possessed the independent authority to decide this critical jurisdictional prerequisite a federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction united states v ruiz  us    sct   ledd   a military commission is no different see rmc ba military commission always has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction the military judge expressly acknowledged in his ruling upon the motion for reconsideration there is no express statutory directive that the government must establish jurisdiction before it is allowed to proceed with a military commission see disposition of prosecution motion for reconsideration at  ¶ e nevertheless the military judge concluded there were clear and unambiguous indicia that congress intended  initial jurisdiction be established before the mechanism set up by the mca was used in the case of a given person id he concluded the only avenue for establishing initial jurisdiction was through a prior determination of unlawful enemy combatant status by a csrt or other competent tribunal id at  ¶ ec while we agree with the military judges view that congress contemplated an initial assessment of an accuseds unlawful enemy combatant status prior to referral of charges to a military commission we disagree with his conclusion that the only avenue for the assessment is that delineated in mca § aaii see mca § ad as previously noted any alien unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents is subject to trial by military commission for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission see mca § ad; rmc b this jurisdiction attaches upon the formal swearing of charges against an accused after an individual subject to the  uniform code of military justice avers under formal oath that the charges are true in fact see rmc c and b charges may then be referred for trial by military commission under rmc  as long as reasonable grounds exist to believe that an offense triable by a military commission has been committed and that the accused committed it rmc d the only relevant limitation upon referral of charges is the requirement in rmc b that inter alia prior to referral the charges must be referred to the convening authoritys legal officer for pretrial advice and that individual must state his/her conclusion as to whether a military commission would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offense see rmc b all of these steps occurred in this case and as previously stated each offense referred for trial against mr khadr clearly alleges the express jurisdictional language used in the mca that he is a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant ae  at  emphasis added we find that this facial compliance by the government with all the prereferral criteria contained in the rules for military commissions combined with an unambiguous allegation in the pleadings that mr khadr is a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant entitled the military commission to initially and properly exercise prima facie personal jurisdiction over the accused until such time as that jurisdiction was challenged by a motion to dismiss for lack thereof or proof of jurisdiction was lacking on the merits in our opinion the mca is clear and deliberate in its creation of a bifurcated methodology for establishing an accuseds unlawful enemy combatant status so as to permit that individuals trial before a military commission these two methods are laid out in mca § aa where an unlawful enemy combatant is defined as emphasis added the disjunctive or between subsections i and ii clearly sets forth alternative approaches for establishing military commission jurisdiction see in re espy  fd   dccir`canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings and a statute written in the disjunctive is generally construed as `setting out separate and distinct alternativesquoting reiter v sonotone corporation  us    sct   ledd   the military judge did not apply the disjunctive separation of these two provisions and erroneously interpreted the distinct provisions as if written in the conjunctive; that is as if joined by the word and rather than or such an  interpretation would render subsection i nothing more than a definition in aid of a csrt or other competent tribunal determination of combatant status under subsection ii and is contradictory to the statutes clear structure wording and overall intent upon challenge the first method by which the mca contemplates jurisdiction being established is by evidence being presented before the military judge factually establishing that an accused meets the definition of unlawful enemy combatant as contained in subsection i in personam criminal jurisdiction over a criminal accused is generally a question of law to be decided by the military judge and is usually resolved only after presentation of evidence supporting jurisdiction and entry of corresponding findings of fact see united states v melanson  mj   caafwhen an accused contests personal jurisdiction on appeal we review that question of law de novo accepting the military judges findings of historical facts unless they are clearly erroneous or unsupported in the record; united states v ernest  mj   cmatwentyfour findings of fact entered by the trial court in determining whether to grant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction; united states v cline  mj   afcmrreturning record to trial court to more fully develop and analyze factual matters serving as basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction; see also united states v anderson  fd   th cirdetermining personal jurisdiction in light of alleged violation of extradition treaty there is a long and welldeveloped tradition in us federal courts and specifically throughout military courtmartial jurisprudence of

dissertation yale law schoollisting numerous cases involving courtmartial litigation to determine jurisdiction; department of the army pamphlet  legal services trial procedure  dec   congress clearly aware of historical courtmartial practice and desiring that military commissions mirror this firmly rooted practice to the maximum extent practicable would not have deprived military commissions of the ability to independently decide personal jurisdiction absent an express statement of such intent no such statement is contained anywhere in the mca the military judges reliance on mca § aaii for the proposition that a military commission itself cannot determine personal jurisdiction is misplaced this provision supports appellants position rather than detracts from it although congress assigned a jurisdictional safe harbor for prior csrt or other competent tribunal determinations of unlawful enemy combatant status by statutorily deeming them dispositive of jurisdiction it did not in any way preclude appellant from proving jurisdiction before the military commission in the absence of such a determination indeed the existence of a statutorily recognized path to  achieve a dispositive determination of jurisdiction suggests that pretrial procedures and pleadings alleging jurisdiction should simply be viewed as nondispositive subsection ii does not eliminate traditional methods of proving jurisdiction before the commission itself we agree with appellants suggestion that congress through subsection ii merely carved out an exception to the military commissions authority to itself determine jurisdictional matters see supplemental brief on behalf of appellant at  as appellant notes subsection ii makes it clear that the military judge is not at liberty to revisit a csrts or other competent tribunals finding of unlawful enemy combatant status when there is such a finding see appellants supplemental brief in response to courts request at oral argument at  however nothing in the mca requires such a finding in order to establish military commission jurisdiction had they so intended congress could have clearly stated in the mca that the only way to establish military commission jurisdiction is through a prior csrt or other competent tribunal determination of unlawful enemy combatant status it did not accordingly we may properly find\\x97as clearly indicated in the language of mca §§ aa and bc\\x97that congress intended for military commissions to apply the principles of law and the procedures for trial routinely utilized by general courtsmartial this would include the common procedures used before general courtsmartial permitting military judges to hear evidence and decide factual and legal matters concerning the courts own jurisdiction over the accused appearing before it this view is supported in the rules for military commissions which provide exactly such procedures rmc b allows an accused to raise a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and recognizes lack of jurisdiction as a nonwaivable ground for dismissal of charges at any stage of the proceedings rmc cb assigns the burden of persuasion to the prosecution on a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction; rmc c sets that burden on any factual issue necessary to resolve the motion as a preponderance of the evidence clearly these rules contemplate potential litigation of personal jurisdictional issues by the military commission and provide the procedures necessary to address such a challenge if the only avenue to achieve military commission jurisdiction was through a previously rendered csrt or  other competent tribunal determination of unlawful enemy combatant status all of these rules would be superfluous as dispositive jurisdiction would have attached before the fact the text structure and history of the mca demonstrate clearly that a military judge presiding over a military commission may determine both the factual issue of an accuseds unlawful enemy combatant status and the corresponding legal issue of the military commissions in personam jurisdiction a contrary interpretation would ignore the bifurcated structure of mca § a and the longstanding history of military judges in general courtsmartial finding jurisdictional facts by a preponderance of the evidence and resolving pretrial motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the mca identifies two potential jurisdictionestablishing methodologies based upon an allegation of unlawful enemy combatant status the first reflected in § aai involves the clear delineation of the jurisdictional standard to be applied by a military commission in determining its own jurisdiction the second contained in § aaii involves a nonjudicial related jurisdictional determination that is to be afforded dispositive deference by the military commission either method will allow the military commissions exercise of jurisdiction where unlawful enemy combatant status has been established by a preponderance of the evidence this interpretation is consistent with the requirements of both the mca and with international lawsee murray v schooner charming betsy  us  cranch    led  acts of congress will generally be construed in a manner so as not to violate international law as we presume that congress ordinarily seeks to comply with international law when legislating because we find the military judge had the power and authority under subsection i of § aa of the mca to hear evidence concerning and to ultimately decide mr khadrs unlawful enemy combatant status we need not address whether or not a military commission is another competent tribunal under subsection ii to make that decision  the military judges ruling he lacked authority to hear evidence

over an accused detainee no such determination has ever been rendered in this case as mentioned earlier the csrt which considered mr khadrs status classified him only as an enemy combatant having rendered no determination of mr khadrs lawful or unlawful status the csrt finding of enemy combatant status is not entitled to enter congress statutory safe harbor an enemy combatant finding is necessary for deciding whether to impose continuing detention upon an individual but it is not dispositive for purposes of establishing military commission jurisdiction   see rmc b discussion the mca

received such a determination he may challenge the personal jurisdiction of the commission through a motion to dismiss   see eg article  of protocol i to the geneva conventions that article suggests that a detained individual who is not being held as a pow has the right to assert an entitlement to pow status before a judicial tribunal and that judicial adjudication of combatant status shall occur before trial for any alleged substantive offense following the mca procedures as we interpret them here would allow an accused to assert a claim of pow ie lawful combatant status at a pretrial motion
